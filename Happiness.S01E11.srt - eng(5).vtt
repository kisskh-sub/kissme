00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.770
Why didn't you tell us that Andrew was the killer?

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.830
I thought he was merely threatening people!

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.420
You said you didn't care about anything else other than getting the food supply.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.290
I only got the door open because you asked me, Building Representative.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.290
I had no idea about this!

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.970
I didn't know either. Oh Joo Hyung is the one who brought this on.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.570
Who are you?

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.550
Andrew. I always wanted to have supernatural powers.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.460
Sae Bom!

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.370
Hyung, please wake up!

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.740
Take good care of his wound.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.380
I'll look after Seo Yoon.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.770
I'll come to get you.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.950
Just wait a little.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.550
Hey… you don't have any facial scars.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.680
Everyone, go down to the gym and wait. I'll bring the two of them when they come out.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.350
Can we not take some food with us now?

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.730
There are people inside.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.770
Let's go and wait then.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.830
Nothing good will come from us seeing what's happening.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.660
The situation isn't suitable for a child—

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.050
Mr. Lawyer, please stay behind.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.420
There was some kind of sound earlier, right?

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.050
Is your brother okay?

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.960
You seem to visit him often.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.680
You didn't go with her, did you?

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.080
My brother is perfectly fine!

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.040
He's being very careful, too,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.170
and the scratch he got from the infected looks the same as before!

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.730
Let's go downstairs now. I have something to discuss about unit 501.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.510
The other residents will be down, too, once they're done with their jobs.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.500
Let's go.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.890
What a mess.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.300
Hyun, get me the first aid kit and water.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.250
Ahjussi, I'll take a look.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.060
Just hold on a little longer.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.080
You can get to a hospital once you get out.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.350
By chance, if I die…

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.280
please tell my wife that I'm sorry...

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.680
and that I love her.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.890
Tell her directly yourself.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.510
You just need to get treated once you get out of here.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.860
Do you... Do you really think I won't die?

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.020
Yes, you just have a small puncture wound on your side.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.150
You're sure it's just a small puncture wound, right?

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.210
Right?

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.350
Just bear with it a little longer.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.220
Bom, Hyung Jung Gook...

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.060
Hyun...

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.760
Hyun... look at me.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.460
We will leave here alive, no matter what,

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.010
and I will lock all those people up.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.460
Please bear with it...

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:25.660
[Happiness]

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.870
[Episode 11]

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.780
Jung Gook got stabbed on his side.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.500
Seo Yoon can't breathe properly, so make sure you have a medical team on standby.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.220
We can come in.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.010
No. Seo Yoon has been taken hostage.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.720
She'll be in danger if you come in.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.110
Mr. Jung Yi Hyun.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.660
I thought about the reason why you're acting this way.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.530
Sae Bom has the antibody, doesn't she?

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.530
What if I say yes?

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.200
You have to give us what we want.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.910
That's the only way she will leave.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.950
Mr. Lawyer,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.450
could you watch her for a second?

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.330
I-I'm not a bad man.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.690
What's your name?

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.490
I know who you are.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.690
- Hey, where are you going? You have to be checked out!
- The hospital.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.860
[Murder]

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:56.210
[Choi Jong Wook]

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.630
You killed the real Ahn Guk Jin, didn't you?

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.310
How many did you kill while hiding your face?

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.670
[Ahn Guk Jin]

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.120
The infected are the same.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.860
Hiding their true self and looking for a victim while hiding among others.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.420
Those people contracted a disease.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.120
You were crazy from the beginning.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.160
Ahjussi... how long have you known?

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.190
I heard you started all this!

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.060
It's been a few days since I saw Andrew dragging away the cleaning lady.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.010
Hold on! Hold on!

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.400
Andrew...

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.900
the 11th floor is empty. Wouldn't it be better to hide her body there?

00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:00.700
If you damage her neck, people might suspect she was one of the infected.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.240
So I told Building Representative about it right away.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.080
I have a suggestion I would like to make.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.260
About how to take care of the residents we don't like.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.280
Building Representative agreed,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.680
so I told Andrew that we would let him do what he wants, as long as he helps us in return.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.020
You should be thanking me.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.460
It's awkward for me to say this myself, but I'm the elite of the elite of the society.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.910
I even acted to fool the couple on the 5th floor for all of your sakes!

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.480
How did you get into

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.050
Kim Se Hoon's apartment?

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.030
He opened the door for me when I mentioned you.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.670
Yoon Se Bom's been hurt.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.270
You have emergency medicine, don't you?

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.650
If you had done what I asked, I wouldn't have had beat you up.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.980
[I made an irreversible mistake...]

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.080
Andrew, this is lime.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.310
You can get rid of the stench completely.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.800
Tell me from there.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.000
It bothers me when you keep moving.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.020
Jung Gook is badly hurt.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.470
He needs to go to the hospital.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.490
After the two of you do what you need to.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.160
You can leave, right?

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.490
Also,

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.680
do you have contact with the outside?

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.500
What are you talking about right now?

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.550
Please explain it in a way we can understand!

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.460
I already told the cleaning crew and the lawyer,

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.560
but I didn't get a chance to tell you both.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.060
My husband, too?

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.790
Yes. I came by to see you.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:22.680
He was happy that the 5th and the 15th floor had lots of food.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.410
What's that?

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.820
Jung Yi Hyun had it.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:59.190
Have you secretly been reporting to the outside about what's going on in here?

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.690
I guess you two were getting something special

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.000
in return for keeping an eye on all of us in here!

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.950
Hello?

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.230
Is anyone there?

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.410
I'm building 101's Building Representative.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:22.220
I'm the one who handles everything in here so whatever you need, you can tell me—

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.380
Hello?

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.350
Is anyone there?

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.000
I told them everything.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.820
About what?

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.010
Did you spread false information about all your delusions?

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.370
Yes! All of it.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:53.250
I'm sure those on the outside will judge everyone's actions in here.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:58.140
You two will go to jail for instigating murder.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.810
And aren't you embarrassed to face your son?

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.140
I only did that because the food was going to be distributed.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.110
Really, I didn't know anything. I'm being honest!

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.530
Food doesn't fall from the sky for no reason.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:18.180
You must have known someone would end up getting hurt.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.860
I'm sure you accepted because you were told you'd benefit if you kept quiet.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.330
No...

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.230
There's no need to worry already.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:31.280
What's important right now is that we hold on until the lockdown is lifted.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.180
Also,

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.110
the couple from 501 promised to go to the electrical room

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.520
and to turn on the emergency power source.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.000
Yes, yes.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.300
Yes, you need to go down, turn it on, and take back the child.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:55.000
If anyone asks why things turned out this way later, say that a crazy guy wielding a gun did all of it.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.970
So are you telling us to turn a blind eye to your crime?

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.600
What? Did I say something wrong?

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.030
Let's not touch other people!

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.200
If the two of us attack you at the same time,

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.420
you might die, too.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.220
Right, we shouldn't fight when you two have a lot left to do.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.740
Na Hyun Kyung, you don't need to stay here. Go home and wait.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.420
You, too, Sin So Yoon.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.310
Your husband should be in our apartment with Seo Yoon.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.930
She's probably in a huge shock.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.070
Please take care of her for us.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.080
I will.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.260
Come back after switching on the electricity.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.320
Then I will free the detective and Seo Yoon.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.070
Do you want to come with us?

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.990
Seo Yoon. I'm okay.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.330
I'm okay, so stay outside.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.730
I might be infected, that's why.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.770
Go outside and wait. I'm okay.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.120
Mr. Lawyer, could you take her to your apartment for me?

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.690
I don't think she should stay here.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.250
Okay. Stop taking deep breaths

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.420
and come with me.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.460
If you stay here, that scary ahjussi will come back.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.620
You don't want him to get mad at you, do you?

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.080
Honey, what are you doing?

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.280
Oh, I'm glad you're here. She has a name similar to you,

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.700
so can you convince her?

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.570
Andrew has a gun. He's threatening the couple from 501.

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.290

He's lying about hiding Andrew. I can kill him, too, if I need to.

01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:12.950
Your antibodies are decreasing.

01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:16.030
Do you want to kill a scholar?

01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:17.680
He's the infected.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.390
You're the monsters, not the infected!

01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:23.950
I'll take care of Yoon Sae Bom myself.

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:26.580
Where's Yi Hyun? Is he alive?

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:30.450
♫ Please, I just want everything to stop, ♫

01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:34.230
♫ With cutting words ♫
