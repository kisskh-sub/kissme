00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.850
[Episode 19]

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.660
When Ms. Fang said that to you,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.640
she wasn't trying
to make things difficult for you.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.570
It was because she didn't know you.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.640
She didn't know how independent you were

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.300
or how strong you were inside.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.770
And also,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.130
how could you possibly be my weakness?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.410
Having you by my side

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.470
is like having a mirror.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.520
You help me see sincerity

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.940
and the human heart.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.710
Come,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.060
sit down for a while.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.450
Are you thirsty?

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.750
Are you thirsty?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.310
A little bit.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.620
Here,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.180
soda.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.079
Where did you get that from?

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.280
I bought it on the way.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.120
Why is there only one bottle?

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.310
I already drank mine.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.280
Will we argue in the future?

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.680
Probably.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.440
Where there are people,
there are conflicts.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.880
Having conflicts isn't scary.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.720
We just need to resolve them.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.020
Will you give in to me?

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.910
That depends on the issue.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.450
If it's not a matter of principle,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.520
you can decide.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.770
But if it's about principles,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.870
I might

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.120
not give an inch.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.390
I won't back down
on matters of principles either.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.000
Good,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.690
I'll remember that.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.750
But you have a high position and power.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.150
You won't use that
to pressure me, will you?

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.400
At home,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.110
you'll be the Chief.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.600
How do you divide ranks in your army?

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.550
In our division, the highest rank
is the division commander,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.150
then the brigade commander,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.480
regiment commander,

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.150
battalion commander, company commander,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.390
platoon leader, and squad leader.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.200
So at home, I'm the Chief.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.920
Then you can be the squad leader.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.240
Can I request not to be a squad leader?

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.500
You think it's too low?

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.410
Maybe I could promote you to...

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.460
Never mind, no promotion.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.370
It depends on your performance.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.570
You'll get promoted only if you do well.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.620
Even if I became a company commander,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.370
I wouldn't want it.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.080
Why not?

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.480
Because

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.120
even a company commander
doesn't get to see the Chief often.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.580
Then which rank
gets to see the Chief easily?

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.510
Let me tell you,

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.790
it's the security guard.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.040
You said it.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.270
Don't go back on your word.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.680
Of course I won't.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.680
Alright.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.710
I approve.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.210
From now on at home,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.680
you'll be Security Guard Wen.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.880
And you're the Chief.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.720
Don't just humor me.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.070
Stand up!

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.170
What for?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.420
Right here, right now?

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.240
Chief's orders: Attention!

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.640
Yes, Ma'am!

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.430
Alright, Security Guard Wen,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.480
let's go home.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.280
Okay.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.660
Yes, Ma'am.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.510
Hangong.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.950
You're learning quite fast.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.750
You're dancing better and better.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.010
It's because you're such a good teacher.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.090
I didn't expect you to be so coordinated.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.830
If I wasn't agile enough,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.270
in that hail of bullets,

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.320
I would've been shot dead long ago.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.580
No matter how agile you are,

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.170
you can't dodge bullets.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.770
You're lying to me again.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.920
I'm not lying to you.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.870
So beautiful.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.430
My sweet darling.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.720
After this dance,

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.020
I have to go.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.560
You're leaving again?

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.870
I've been with you all day.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.000
You still won't let me go?

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.410
I need to go

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.480
to Wen Pu's place.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.790
He's not even your superior.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.830
Why do you always run to him

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.490
as soon as you get to Shanghai?

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.180
My silly darling.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.750
I have to go

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.120
to check in with him.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.650
When will you come back next time?

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.310
Whenever you need me,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.159
I'll be here.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.560
Remember to think of me.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.800
I will.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.740
I will.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.110
I promise.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.430
Ms. Yi.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.670
I don't know what's going on
with my husband lately.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.800
Who knows what
he's busy with out there all day?

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.400
He still hasn't shown up yet.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.340
Why don't we start eating first?

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.800
We can eat while waiting for him.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.660
It's fine. I'm not hungry either.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.390
Don't you agree, Minister Wen?

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.070
Alright.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.510
Let's wait for him
10 more minutes at most.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.600
If he doesn't show up,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.000
we'll start without him.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:14.800
Um...

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.050
Political Commissar.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.460
Can I talk to you about something?

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.540
Sure, what is it?

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.620
Let's talk in the kitchen.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.460
You need to talk in the kitchen?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.240
All right.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.630
What is it, Jiang?

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.630
Open the door.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.520
Why are you closing the door?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.800
Go ahead.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.120
Political Commissar.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.720
I don't have anything specific.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.290
I just feel troubled.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.870
I feel that these days,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.710
you're the only one
I can really open up to

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.130
and speak honestly with.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.630
Did something happen with Hangong?

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.680
Political Commissar.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.830
Why do you immediately think

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.580
of Hangong when I say
I have something to discuss?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.630
What's wrong with him?

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.090
If it's not about Hangong,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.410
why would you need to talk to me?

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.390
Don't you think that this past year,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.360
he's changed too much?

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.800
Changes this year...

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.230
Yes, there have been some.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.630
He just moved to the city.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.280
He's paying attention to his appearance.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.390
But that's normal.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.990
He's the district secretary

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.710
and has to deal with all kinds of people.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.160
It's normal to care about his appearance,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.690
isn't it?

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.270
If he's busy with work,

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.040
I understand that.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.130
I support him.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.429
But for the past several months,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.890
he's been going out every weekend.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.240
When I ask where he's going,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.770
he says he's busy with work.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:38.750
He gets impatient.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.000
If I ask again, he gets angry.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.840
I know.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.150
He's been busy with construction site
matters these past months.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.080
But come on,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.480
he's a grown man

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.030
with a wife and child.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.240
Sure, working overtime occasionally

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.510
is understandable.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.630
But not coming home every weekend

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.030
and always rushing off to Shanghai?

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.960
What do you think he's doing there?

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.240
Visiting you?

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.080
Does this make any sense?

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.630
Do you think he's seeing someone else?

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.770
We can't make wild guesses.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.480
It could cause family conflicts.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.880
Do you have any evidence?

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:11.440
That's right.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.000
I know Hangong well.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.460
He values relationships.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.630
I think toward his family,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.170
toward you and Huzi,

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.720
he's always been responsible.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.390
Right?

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.670
But I'm afraid he'll make a mistake.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.960
You know.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.240
He has that old problem.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.580
Back then,

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.550
if he hadn't made that mistake,

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.240
he wouldn't have had
to transfer to civilian work.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.100
He's still one rank below you now.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.690
Precisely because
he made that mistake before,

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.870
I believe he won't

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.750
stumble in the same place again.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.440
Alright, Jiang.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:46.750
If you're worried,

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.790
I'll find a chance

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.880
to have a good talk with Hangong.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.050
Alright, Political Commissar.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.120
I believe you.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.080
And if Hangong

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.270
repeats that indiscretion,

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.730
you'll see how I
deal with him when I get home.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.440
Secretary Zhao.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.510
I rushed here as fast as I could.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.670
Why are you so late?

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.170
Well...

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.150
My car broke down,

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.480
and I didn't bring my watch, you know.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.510
Please sit down.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.790
I lost track of time.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:22.510
Where are the two of them?

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.600
They're in the kitchen.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.490
Minister Wen.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.670
-Secretary Zhao is here.
-Coming.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:26.670
I'm back.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:27.520
Coming.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.960
Why are you late?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.080
My car broke down.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.550
What have you been
tattling to Minister Wen about?

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.550
Sit down, please.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.480
She wasn't tattling.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.440
She was just concerned about you.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.270
Concerned about me?

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.030
Yes.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.030
She said that for the past few weeks,

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.960
you haven't been home on Sundays.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:44.910
Right?

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.900
She's worried you're not
eating and drinking well outside.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.500
Is it wrong to care about you?

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.630
No, it's not.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.720
But if you have something to say,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.240
well...

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.080
Why come here to report it?

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:56.390
Just tell me at home.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.650
I didn't say anything.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.670
Well...

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.440
I've told her so many times.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.510
I said that at the construction site,

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.150
there are so many people,

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.480
several dozens of them.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.950
I have to take care of their meals.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.310
Then there are materials

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.550
and supplies to handle.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.210
Don't I have to go buy all that?

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.910
About these things, what...

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.710
What do you know? Yet you're here

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.200
talking nonsense
to the Political Commissar.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.770
What did you say?

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.030
I didn't say anything.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.270
You should

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.030
learn from Ms. Yi.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.840
Look at her.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.480
Isn't she a role model right beside you?

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.080
Secretary Zhao,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.720
you shouldn't say that.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.670
I'm no role model.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.900
You didn't see
what just happened in the kitchen.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.270
This whole spread of dishes

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.370
was almost entirely cooked by your wife.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.230
She's really skilled at domestic chores.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.870
I have a lot to learn from her.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.020
Yes.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.720
Her... Her cooking is fine.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.080
I've been to his construction site.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.030
There are many people there.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.960
It really needs someone to manage.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.250
Hangong.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.480
I wronged you.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.620
I shouldn't have overthought.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.670
Well...

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.720
That's how she is. Look.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.300
If you have anything to say,
tell me at home.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.760
I didn't say anything.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:22.370
Secretary Zhao.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.490
Secretary Zhao,
someone's looking for you outside.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.020
Looking for me?

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.700
Yes, and he seems very urgent.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.590
Who is it? Why don't we let him in?

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.600
No, no, no.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.670
Um, you...

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.520
You stay and eat with them.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.470
It must be about the project.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.970
Please go ahead and eat.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.630
Who is it?

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.770
How did you find me here?

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.360
Hangong,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.480
I had no choice. My sister...

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.680
Keep your voice down.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.240
Hangong, I had no choice.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.170
My sister swallowed the gold ring.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.610
My sister swallowed the gold ring.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.650
Step aside!

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:04.030
Step aside!

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.870
Pu.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.540
Something happened
at my construction site.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.960
I need to check it out.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.290
You all go ahead and eat.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.670
That's strange.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.030
What are you looking for?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.510
My chair.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.010
Oh right.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.720
I put that chair here.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720
Have you seen it?

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.570
I threw it away.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.150
You threw it away?

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.710
That chair could
still be used after some repairs.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.510
It made me fall last time.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.480
Better get rid of it
before someone else falls off it.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.650
It could

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.730
have been repurposed into something else.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.530
Why did you have to throw it away?

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.440
I bought you a new chair.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.790
Where is it?

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.670
In the living room. Go take a look.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.210
This chair looks really nice.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.460
You know what?

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.670
It matches the study perfectly.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.840
It must be

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.900
expensive, right?

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.240
Just tell me if you like it or not.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.720
Of course I like it.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.750
But it's too luxurious for me.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.510
I prefer

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.460
a simple and frugal lifestyle.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.150
Of course,

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.920
that's my personal choice.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.030
I know you Communists

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.630
advocate for simplicity and frugality,

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.440
integrity and dedication
to public service.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.200
But you don't have to

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.320
live like an ascetic monk.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.840
I truly believe

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.620
you're already
a very dedicated public servant.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.660
Are you restraining yourself

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.010
and rejecting all material temptations

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.670
because you're afraid that someday

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.270
you might become corrupt?

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.510
I'm not a saint.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.840
I'm just an ordinary person.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.270
What you described...

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.670
I don't deny it.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.320
I understand.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.870
Material life can be simple and frugal,

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.470
but your spiritual world
shouldn't be dull and boring.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.000
You agree with that, right?

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.910
Alright.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.510
Next time when I
want to throw something away,

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.240
I'll discuss it with you first.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.910
Thank you.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:43.910
I promise you too

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.190
that our material life
can be simple and frugal,

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.910
but our spiritual life

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.410
will definitely be rich and colorful.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.000
Thank you.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.120
Come in.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.000
Yuanyuan's clothes have a tear.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.260
I'm mending it for her.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.320
Let me see.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.240
Almost done.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.680
How is it?

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.850
Security Guard Wen.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.970
People should focus on
what they are each good at.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.640
Aren't you stealing my job?

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.670
How could I steal your job?

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.190
You're a great designer.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.050
Please, designer,
take a look at my sewing.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.010
What's wrong?

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.860
Why is this bed nothing
but a wooden plank?

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.100
-Yeah.
-Where's your mattress?

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.030
I don't have one.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.790
I have a back injury.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.800
The doctor said sleeping on this hard bed
is good for my back.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.480
You've been sleeping
on this for all these years?

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.200
Yes.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.510
The floor is harder.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.570
Why don't you sleep on the floor then?

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.440
The floor is too cold.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.640
You think I'm stupid?

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.390
My grandfather
was a traditional Chinese doctor.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.270
I can tell you with certainty.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.280
Back injuries do require firm beds.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.140
But a firm bed
doesn't mean a wooden plank like this.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:04.660
Really?

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:05.369
Of course.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.200
Well...

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.000
You're not planning to take away my bed

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.329
and replace it, are you?

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.349
I might.

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:15.770
If you dare to replace it,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.490
I'll sleep on the floor.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.480
Then sleep on the floor.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.030
You really want me to sleep on the floor?

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.030
Aren't you afraid I'll catch a cold?

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.160
I'll bring you a mattress pad then.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.290
That's more like it.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.970
What are you looking at?

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.140
There's a hole in my pants.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.480
Can you mend it?

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.880
You always ask me to help you with chores.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.030
So you need to do me a favor too.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.590
Sure.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.210
What do you want me to do?

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.190
Secretary Zhao told me
you can fix watches.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.400
My aunt gave me an old pocket watch.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.640
It's not working now.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.920
Can you fix it for me?

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.720
Okay.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.270
I'll give it a try.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:15.920
No.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.280
I will definitely fix it for you.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.470
Yuanyuan and I...

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.230
What's wrong?

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.170
We're thirsty.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.510
I've prepared
some chilled watermelon for you.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.350
I'll cut it in half.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.830
You can use spoons to scoop it out.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:29.350
Okay.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:41.550
Yuanyuan.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.000
Your dad prepared watermelon for us.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.880
We'll share it later

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.240
and eat it with spoons, alright?

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.920
Okay.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:57.240
I'm here.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:59.520
Well,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.880
I should go now.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.830
You can go in.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.570
You should go first.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.610
I'll leave after I see you go in.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.400
Go ahead.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:10.510
Okay.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.200
Let me accompany you to the station.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.890
Alright.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.890
I'm leaving.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.010
Oh, right.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.930
Be careful on your night shift.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.030
Sir!

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:09.750
Comrade!

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.400
Take care.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.510
You should go now.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.880
We've seen each other off
several times already.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.480
If you don't leave,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.060
I'll be late for my night shift.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:18.900
I'll go then.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:19.960
Hurry up.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:26.310
Sir,

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.060
you almost left without me.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.530
I brought all your favorites.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:50.920
There are red dates,

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.790
vermicelli,

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:52.680
and corn.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.090
The corn grew
exceptionally well this year.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:55.960
Ms. Yi.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.270
Changjiang.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:58.650
This is...

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.800
This is my brother Baoliang.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.240
So you're Baoliang.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.200
Hello, Ms. Yi.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.350
Hello, I'm Yi Yi.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.160
You've grown so much.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.840
Which one of you is older?

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.920
I'm the older one.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.120
You're the older one?

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.750
Where's your dad?

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.860
My dad and my father are in the study.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:15.960
Alright,

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.890
you two chat,

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.650
I'll go wash some fruit for you.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.310
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.680
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.610
Please sit down.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.400
Try one.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.000
Here, my brother.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.930
Have some water.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.080
Political Commissar Wen,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.840
is this the lady your...

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.700
Yes, I mentioned her in my letter.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.510
Yi Yi.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:36.480
Look,

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.200
I can be so clueless sometimes.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.070
You're having your Sunday together,

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.340
and I'm interrupting your meeting.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.750
My brother.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.510
You're treating me like an outsider.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.450
It's been so long
since we've seen each other.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:48.490
I'm very happy

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.840
to see you and Baoliang.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.590
Well,

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.760
don't prepare anything for me.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.640
I've already bought my ticket.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.680
I'm leaving tonight.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.890
You're leaving tonight?

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:00.520
Yes.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.860
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.400
You rarely come to Shanghai.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.070
Stay and enjoy yourself.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.160
I'll ask Changjiang

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.510
to take time off from school

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.030
so he can accompany Baoliang and you

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.140
to explore Shanghai properly.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.180
Maybe next time.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.070
You know there's always
work to do in the village.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.470
Chores from dawn to dusk.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.370
Baoliang's mother isn't home.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.590
I need to get back quickly.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:19.410
Baoliang...

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.350
If he...

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.080
If he wants to stay, he can stay.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:25.440
Political Commissar Wen.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.640
These past few years,

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.010
you've sent plenty of money to my family.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.720
I appreciate your kindness.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.200
Listen to yourself.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.160
Your family has shown

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.160
tremendous kindness to mine.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.110
I'll never forget that.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.030
My brother.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.070
Your hair has turned completely white.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.610
I'm old. If it wasn't white,
I'd be some kind of monster.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.270
The reason I came this time...

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.830
I came for the sake of the child.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.790
I...

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.170
I explained everything in my letter.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.510
I'm being shameless

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.560
coming to you

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.790
to ask for a favor.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.400
Forgive my nagging.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.860
Political Commissar Wen.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:08.920
Well,

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.110
I still want

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.950
Baoliang

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.920
to work in Shanghai.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.110
This boy

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.550
has high aspirations.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.510
He's always talking about

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.880
his dreams and ideals.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.270
So,

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.310
could you put in a good word

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.000
to help the boy out?

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.070
I received the letter

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.550
you sent me.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.570
I wrote back to you as well.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.920
Here's the situation now.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.790
As for working in the city,

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:39.450
there are state regulations.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.480
I've thought carefully
about Baoliang's situation.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.080
If he wants a government job,

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.840
there are only two paths.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.490
One is joining the army.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.110
The other is through factory recruitment.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.240
Both are official channels.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.370
You don't understand.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.930
Factory jobs

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.300
and army positions

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.910
are extremely limited.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.350
By the time my boy gets a chance,

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.280
he'll already have kids of his own.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.270
I mean,

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.310
you are

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.240
such a high-ranking official.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.310
If you

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.090
just say something,

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.830
if you just put in a word

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.200
and write a note
to our county officials...

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.640
Our county magistrate

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.640
never gets to see you.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.550
If he met you,

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.680
he'd wet himself.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.220
Just like that,
the matter would be resolved.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:27.810
Well.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.580
My brother.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.220
It's not as simple as you make it sound.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.940
Really.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:33.070
This note

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.640
can't just be written on demand.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.900
Why can't you write it?

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.920
Look at you.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.750
You've been a revolutionary all your life

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.040
and made such great contributions.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.400
Your position is so high.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.640
I just happen to

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.110
have this connection between us.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.400
I'm not trying to take advantage.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.790
I'm saying it's fate.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.830
People in my situation

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.350
have all moved to the city
with their families.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:52.160
My brother.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.030
If what you described is really happening,

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.030
then it's against the regulations.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.400
In short,

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.240
I cannot write this note.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.590
It violates discipline.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.650
You wouldn't want me
to violate the rules, would you?

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:12.310
I...

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.030
I...

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.320
No, I wouldn't.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.030
Political Commissar Wen,

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.000
I understand.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.400
You want to be

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.230
an incorruptible official.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:29.750
I know

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.280
that such officials

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:32.900
show no favoritism.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.590
Fine,

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.310
I get it.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.680
Baoliang!

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.110
Baoliang!

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.070
Pack your things.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.880
My brother.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.480
My brother, calm down.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.070
Take it easy.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.750
But...

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.510
I can't violate the rules, you understand?

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.590
I know.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:59.190
I won't make you violate any.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.110
Political Commissar Wen,
take care of yourself.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.880
My brother,

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.510
please calm down, will you?

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.510
I'm fine. Changjiang,

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.270
I'm confused.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.960
Why do I keep calling
the child Changjiang?

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.070
Baoliang!

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.640
Come down.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:17.290
Father.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.030
My brother.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.030
Pack up. We're leaving.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:20.720
No, no, no.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.550
Why leave when you just arrived?

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.920
No, no, well...

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.750
Son,

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.590
I'm leaving.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.310
Take care of yourself.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.120
Pack your things.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.370
Why leave so soon after arriving?

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.310
Let Baoliang stay here for a few days.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.180
Let the child play here for a while, okay?

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.250
Maybe next time.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:38.270
Well...

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:39.610
We won't trouble you.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.160
What are you standing there for?

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.920
We need to go back
and harvest sweet potatoes.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.140
Weren't you going
to let me stay in Shanghai

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.540
and live with my brother?

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.590
Stop it.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:50.950
Dad.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.000
You're making my father and brother leave?

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Don't speak.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:55.870
Why should I?

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.560
You and mom had me

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.480
but never took care of anything.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.970
You cast me off to my father,
mother, and brother.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.920
When the Japanese
were conducting massive raids,

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.680
if it weren't for my father and mother,

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.410
I would have been dead long ago.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.680
My brother worked
to earn money for my education.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.970
He was so young when he started
collecting stones in the mountains.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:18.630
He gave all the good food to me.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.410
He fainted from hunger many times.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.310
Mr. Xu.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.640
Don't worry.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:29.130
Come.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:30.160
Come over here.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:30.820
Have a seat.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.160
Let me tell you something.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:36.880
As it happens,

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.160
our workshop needs to hire a male worker.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.680
As long as he's in good health

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.640
and his family background
checks out, it's fine.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.070
The job is very simple.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.760
He just needs to be literate.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.000
The only downside
is that it's a temporary position.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.040
Maybe we'll have to

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.770
have Baoliang humble himself.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:54.220
That's fine.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.970
Don't worry about our family background.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.530
It's completely clean.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.400
Baoliang

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.350
works hard

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:03.810
and is very reliable.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.070
I think it's good.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:05.730
Brother,

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.270
you should keep working hard for now.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.130
Later you can attend night school

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.460
and definitely find a good job.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.310
No, let me ask you.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:13.080
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.540
I know your organization.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.510
Does your organization
have this authority?

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:18.030
Do you have this authority?

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.510
It's just a temporary position.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:20.480
We can make this decision ourselves.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.210
People will gossip about this.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.610
Absolutely not.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.270
Why not?

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.170
You're just afraid of gossip.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.240
You're worried about
your official position.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.110
In your eyes,

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.530
your position
is more important than your children.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.260
Changjiang.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.110
Don't talk nonsense.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.920
If you make my brother leave,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.590
I'll leave too.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:38.440
I'll go back to my hometown.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.970
What are you saying, child?

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.640
This is your real father.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.970
Think before you speak.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:43.960
Did you hear me?

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.770
Why did you even have me?

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.110
You did not raise me,
and yet you never repaid those who did.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.350
You're just selfish.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.960
My mom was just as selfish as you.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:59.590
What did you say?

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.920
Don't talk about your mom like that.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.110
Changjiang!

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:06.280
Where...

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.110
Where did he run off to?

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.750
I...

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.450
It's all my fault.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.240
Political Commissar Wen,

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.880
I shouldn't have come here to do this.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.830
I was wrong.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.240
My brother.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.000
I really have been foolish.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.180
Political Commissar Wen,

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.150
I'm a muddle-headed person.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.150
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.910
Our boys won't have any problems, will he?

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:36.520
The children will be fine.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.550
Shanghai has excellent public security.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.590
Besides, they're two boys.

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.120
They aren't that delicate.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.830
Good.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.510
Baoliang...

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:46.720
He...

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.640
Baoliang

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.750
can stay in Shanghai for a few more days.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.550
I'll have Changjiang show him around.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.310
Don't worry.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.270
Let them bond with each other.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:56.590
Alright.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.440
Fine.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.350
My brother.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:00.510
I know

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.030
Changjiang was raised by you and Mrs. Xu

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.750
at the risk of your lives,

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:06.430
with great hardship.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.200
He is my son,

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:10.960
but in my heart,

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.840
he is your son too.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:15.960
I...

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.110
Yes.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:19.830
Also,

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.830
New China has been established.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:23.920
In the future,

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:24.960
rural areas

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.060
will be built up just like cities.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.200
By then, city people might

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.440
all be rushing to go to the countryside.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.110
Really?

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:33.440
Really.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.750
Live well,

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:36.810
and we'll all be able to see it.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:37.800
Alright.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:38.640
Live well.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:53.720
Alright.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.920
Come on, get up there.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.240
I'll help you up.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:56.830
Okay.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.790
Fine, I'll hold it.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:00.680
I'm leaving.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.830
I'll see you off.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:02.640
Okay.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:03.640
Come on.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.000
Give me the money.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.960
Are you hungry?

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.920
I'm starving.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.590
I'm hungry too.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.410
If you're hungry, just go home.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.770
Mr. Wen is your father.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.610
That smack of his didn't even hurt.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.340
I won't go back.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.210
Communist officials can't just hit people.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.840
He needs to apologize
and write a letter of self-reflection.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.270
Baoliang.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.550
Mr. Wen.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.110
Hello, Ms. Yi.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.510
Come down.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:41.910
It's dangerous up there.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.410
Changjiang.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.360
Come down.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.170
You must be hungry.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:56.980
Here.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.290
These are for you two.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.640
Eat up.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:09.850
Go ahead, eat something.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:17.920
Son.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:20.640
I need to talk to you.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:24.680
Keep eating.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.920
When you were born,

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.070
your mom and I were fighting
as guerrillas in the mountains.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.730
We had nothing to eat or drink.

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.960
Your mother was sick
and couldn't produce milk.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.020
Hunger has left you

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.510
all skin and bones.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.090
When the enemy came,

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.490
your mom was afraid you would cry.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.210
But you didn't
make a sound the whole time.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.920
You were too hungry to even cry.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.440
The day we sent you away,

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.430
I remember it clearly.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.130
Your mom couldn't bear to let you go.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.260
She held you tight and wouldn't let go.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.200
So, son,

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:04.480
I can't accept

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.290
that you called your mom

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.990
selfish.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.920
Your dad told me on the way here

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.550
that he was wrong.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.030
He shouldn't have hit you.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.070
He came here today

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:21.550
to apologize to you.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.920
But he's not good with words,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.160
so he couldn't express himself clearly.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.510
You should go home first.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:30.790
I'll keep an eye on him.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.720
I'll make him write you
a letter of self-reflection.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.070
Well,

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:38.290
I've spoken with the school.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.170
I've asked for two days off for you

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.880
to spend time with Baoliang

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.140
and have a good time exploring Shanghai.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:46.550
-Go.
-Go back.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.360
Let's go.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:59.480
This kid,

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.630
glaring at me like I'm his enemy.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.300
If I were him, I'd glare at you too.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.570
I need to thank you.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:10.510
Thank you

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.280
for helping me with the apology.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.000
Also,

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.940
I want to apologize to you too.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:18.030
I shouldn't have

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:20.429
treated my child
so roughly in front of you.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:21.840
Why are you apologizing to me?

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.840
You didn't hit me.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.139
My father used to
hit me when I was little.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.630
I hated it so much.

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.670
I still remember it to this day.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.510
That's why you shouldn't hit children.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.960
If you had hit Yuanyuan today, I...

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.150
How could I ever hit Yuanyuan?

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.679
I love her too much for that.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.239
Just tell me, have you ever hit her?

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:40.320
I never hit Yuanyuan.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.120
Impossible.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:42.230
Yuanyuan told me everything.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.070
You hit her.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.520
Three times, in fact.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.030
She told you I hit her?

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.800
What exactly did she say?

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.920
She told me.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.920
You hit her when she was

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.650
one year old.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.800
Then again when she was two.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.510
And once more when she was three.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:54.320
That's nonsense.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.920
How could a one-year-old
have such memories?

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.320
She really told you this?

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:57.790
Yes.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.950
That's exactly what Yuanyuan told me.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:04.150
Let's go.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:06.150
Go home and write
your letter of self-reflection.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.510
Fine, I'll write it. Keep your voice down.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.710
Write two copies. One for Yuanyuan too.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:11.630
Okay.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.560
Three, two, one, begin!

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.710
Come on!

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:16.510
Changjiang!

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.150
Like father, like son, they say.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:23.150
You...

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.320
You're weak as water, young man.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.070
But that's just like your father.

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:33.190
Your father could never
beat me at arm wrestling either.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.880
But his hand with a brush

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.440
was quite...

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:38.340
What are you talking about?

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:39.760
Talking behind my back?

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.710
Bragging again?

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.480
I didn't say anything.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.150
I was talking about Changjiang.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.960
I... I...

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:46.000
I was saying how each new generation

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.590
surpasses the one before.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.030
Who won?

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.070
I did.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:50.800
You won?

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:52.230
So strong, huh?

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.760
Come on, try me.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.280
Thanks.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.480
No bullying now!

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:00.110
Come on.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.500
Right hand.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.400
Right hand.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.030
Okay.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:06.480
Move in closer.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.280
Okay, closer.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.650
Put some muscle into it!

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.400
Ready.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.280
Begin!

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Come on, Brother!

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.730
You can do it!

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:16.340
I have to say, this kid's pretty strong.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.000
Come on, Baoliang!

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:17.400
Come on, Baoliang!

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:17.920
Push harder, Brother!

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.380
Come on!

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:22.880
Give up?

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.510
I give up.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.070
But you're pretty strong.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.490
Hangong.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.070
Let's try.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.880
My wrist hurts.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.110
I'm too weak for this.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:35.170
Changjiang, go on.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.000
Try against your dad.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.400
Yes, challenge your dad.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.630
I can't. I won't win.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.030
How do you know you can't?

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.980
I've arm wrestled him before.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.670
You can do it. Trust me.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:44.550
I really can't.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.590
You really can. Go on.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.390
Come on, young man. Give it a try.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.190
That was before.

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:50.190
Come here.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.230
Mr. Zhao is right.

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.640
How would you know
you can't do it if you don't try?

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:56.850
Come on.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.920
No cheating.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.720
I won't cheat.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.630
Give us a head start of a fist and a half.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:02.560
A fist and a half?

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:03.560
No need for that.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.150
Just arm wrestle fair and square.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:06.070
I can't beat him.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:07.150
You definitely can.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.960
Trust me.

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:10.310
Come on! Changjiang.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.400
Alright.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:11.860
Come on.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:12.920
Ready.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:13.960
Go!

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:15.480
Come on!

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:15.960
You can do it!

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.480
-You’re much stronger than before.
-Come on.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.080
Keep it up!

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.000
Come on!

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:20.670
Harder!

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.840
Put some muscle into it!

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.030
Harder!

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.440
Let's see how long you can hold on.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:24.880
You got this!

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.320
Come on!

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.110
Kid.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.280
Come on!

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.400
That's cheating!

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:32.280
Three against one?

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.510
Is that even fair?

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.670
See? I told you that you could do it.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:36.880
If you're going to cheat,

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.010
then I'll cheat too.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.410
About those two essays
I was supposed to write tonight,

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.190
consider them canceled out by this.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.630
Essays? What essays?

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:46.320
The two essays you mentioned.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.540
They're canceled.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.390
But thank you anyway.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.840
Alright.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:54.760
I'll make something delicious for you all.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.530
Can't have you eating bread all the time.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:57.180
Hangong.

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.030
Give me a hand.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.830
Sure.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:37:59.770
Coming!

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:00.880
Dad.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.360
I want stir-fried rice cakes.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.320
Stir-fried rice cakes? No problem.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.880
Stir-fried rice cakes?

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.570
Look who's ordering food now.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:13.910
Yi.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:14.840
Yi.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.190
I need to go now.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.690
There's an urgent situation.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.880
The higher-ups

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.880
want to check our exhibition clothing

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.010
before the international trade fair.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:26.930
Looks like we need to speed things up.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.030
Is the timeline tight?

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.320
It's quite tight.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.760
We only have two months.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.590
We need to complete your designs

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:34.850
and manufacture the finished products.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.180
Looks like we'll be working overtime.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.880
Your enthusiasm

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.800
is back again.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.510
Pressure creates motivation.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:43.000
I've been dragging my feet before.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.320
Never finalized the design plan.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.320
This time we need to decide quickly.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:48.690
I'll let you get to work then.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.670
I have a pile of things
to handle at the workshop.

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:51.760
I'll head over there now.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.480
Alright.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.040
Okay.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.480
If you have any ideas or thoughts,

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.550
you can tell me.

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:14.940
I'll help you choose

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.090
for your reference.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.370
My creative concept this time

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.130
is rooted in ethnic themes,

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.400
infused with an international touch.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.920
So it's a fusion
of Chinese and Western styles, right?

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.590
Yes.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.590
That's a great approach.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.510
East meets West.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.230
Greek civilization
is the origin of all Western civilization.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.030
You might

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.400
find this book useful for reference.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.840
Your creative thinking aligns with mine.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:42.000
Is that

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:42.980
a compliment?

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.110
Of course it is.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:45.850
I gladly accept it.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.280
So you revolutionaries
also read Greek mythology?

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.030
Of course.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.030
Which character do you like in it?

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.960
-I like...
-Wait.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.630
Let me guess.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.510
Okay.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.950
You like...

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:06.800
You must like Prometheus.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.630
I do like Prometheus.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:10.760
I admit it.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:12.710
I admire him

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.240
for not fearing authority,

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.030
for enduring all kinds of hardships,

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:17.670
and for his tenacious willpower.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:18.960
His spirit deserves

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.470
to be learned from
and admired by humanity.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.550
What about you?

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.410
Who do you like?

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.590
You'll never guess who I like.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:27.770
Let me try to guess.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:34.070
Which character
would our comrade Yi Yi like?

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.590
The goddess of wisdom,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:38.760
Athena?

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.150
No.

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:42.030
Then who?

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.050
I like Marpessa.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:44.970
Marpessa?

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.590
Marpessa, among all the gods,

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.250
chose an ordinary life.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.710
Tell me,

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:51.880
why do you like her?

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.320
Because I feel those heroes and gods

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.670
are too distant from me.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.150
Apollo

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:58.720
loved Marpessa

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.730
and promised her immortality,

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.560
but she gave up immortality.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.510
She chose her own kind,

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.360
saying she was just an ordinary person.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.110
She wanted to grow old

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.480
with her husband.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.960
I find it remarkable

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.620
that the ancient Greeks
possessed such insight

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:16.400
into love and marriage.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:17.590
I think

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.480
you're telling me this story

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.880
to ask me to make a choice.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:22.360
Not at all.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.440
I didn't say anything.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.230
You didn't say anything directly,

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:27.110
but sometimes the speaker is unintentional
while the listener finds meaning.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:28.960
I think this story you told

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.150
is suggesting I make a choice:

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:34.110
If one day

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.670
you agree to live with me,

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.190
first,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.150
I would have to leave my current position,

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.670
right?

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:43.440
Comrade Wen Pu.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:44.150
What is it?

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:46.830
As your chief,
I must seriously criticize you.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.570
You've been too sensitive lately.

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:49.410
Really?

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:50.920
Okay.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.960
I accept the chief's criticism

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:56.010
and will correct it immediately.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.590
By the way,

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.840
I

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.150
want to apologize

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.000
by giving you a gift.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:03.500
What kind of gift?

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:04.700
Here.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.300
Sit down first.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.230
Close your eyes.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:17.550
I have to close my eyes too?

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:18.840
Yes. Close your eyes.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.110
I'm afraid I'll peek.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:22.630
No peeking.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.120
Close your eyes.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.630
Okay. Eyes closed.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:32.880
Don't peek.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.110
Almost done.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.050
You can open your eyes now.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:47.630
A Leica camera.

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:48.640
Yes, a Leica camera.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.450
Do you like it?

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.760
Wait, this model is discontinued.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.310
It is.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.660
Where did you get it?

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:54.840
I didn't buy it.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.880
It's a trophy.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.280
Editor-in-Chief Ji gave it to me.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.990
Now I'm giving it to you.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.240
No.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.440
It's too valuable. I can't accept it.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.480
You must take it.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.410
Think about how useful it will be
when you're gathering material.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.290
Just like the pen I gave you.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.400
It will definitely help
with your creative work.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.280
Well.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:15.670
Comrade Yi Yi.

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:17.850
I hope you accept my apology.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:20.800
But...

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.630
But I don't have any gift for you.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:24.330
You did.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.590
What?

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:27.540
You.
