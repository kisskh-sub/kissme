1
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:10,400
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,324
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,360
Letter.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,080
From Xiao Xian.

5
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:29,280
(To Princess Ruihua)

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,880
Very well.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,680
Everything was premeditated.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,800
What does it say?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,880
It's written by Xiao Xian's father.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,920
He said that Xiao Xian
is his flesh and blood,

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,600
and will never be adopted by Prince Rui

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,720
to inherit the title.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,360
He wanted to sever ties
with the mansion.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,000
Perfect.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,320
His leaving will bring peace.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,040
Is this the residence you found?

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,640
Xu Ziyi persuaded you
to take me away, didn't she?

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,640
What do you mean?

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,840
Xu Ziyi must have scouted this location.

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,960
We haven't had time to clean the house.

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,120
Yet oddly enough,

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,840
there's a prepared pot of tea.

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,760
Don't you find this suspicious?

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,360
Xu Ziyi prepared it?

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,080
Xu Ziyi

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,160
is clever

27
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,880
but malicious.

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,400
She made you take me away

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,560
as part of her scheme

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,400
to have me killed outside,

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,400
and frame you as the suspect.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,640
Then why drink it?

33
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,280
She's cunning.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,240
But I've been waiting

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,920
to take advantage of her.

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,440
Don't worry.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,640
It's fine.

38
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,000
You're right.

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,440
You have covert allies.

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,560
Shentu Yu devised this, didn't he?

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,640
Sun Qi,

42
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
Luo Qingqing,

43
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,440
Uncle Luo,

44
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,440
Aunt,

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,600
and He Laijin.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
I could dismantle them step by step,

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
because I had help.

48
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,040
Do you want to know

49
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,040
my entire plan?

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,360
I'm not who I used to be.

51
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,680
I carry a blood feud,

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,160
forcing me to scheme endlessly.

53
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
This stage today

54
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,280
was built for Xu Ziyi.

55
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,000
I need your full cooperation.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,880
They're here.

57
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,120
If you want to leave,

58
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,960
I won't stop you.

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,480
But Prince Rui's heir

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,600
stays with me.

61
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
You mentioned Prince Rui's heir.

62
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,880
I presume my terms

63
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,720
have been accepted?

64
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,080
I've secured an imperial decree

65
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,000
to legitimize you and your unborn child.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,080
You'll be named Prince Rui's Consort.

67
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,720
No!

68
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,640
Are you insane?

69
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,880
Why say this?

70
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,880
You clearly...

71
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Xu Ziyi told me you're not pregnant.

72
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Exposure would mean execution.

73
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,880
Yet you let her bring this decree.

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,400
This is treasonous deception.

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,520
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

76
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,400
Stop!

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,080
What are you doing?

78
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,000
If she accepts this decree,

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,240
the entire mansion

80
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,760
will be doomed.

81
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,840
Hong Linlang

82
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,440
is not pregnant.

83
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,360
What did you say?

84
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,360
He's lying.

85
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160
Your Highness,

86
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,280
if it isn't issued,

87
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,440
some secrets can stay buried.

88
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,160
You can still claim she's unworthy

89
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,200
and return the decree.

90
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,360
Your Highness,

91
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,400
will you risk this?

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,640
Your Highness,

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,480
he's spouting nonsense

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,720
out of self-interest.

95
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,480
If you return the decree,

96
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,480
who'll inherit

97
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,280
the title?

98
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,760
I'm saving you!

99
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,640
Your Highness,

100
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,280
if I fake pregnancy to accept this,

101
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,160
it's a capital crime.

102
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,400
Do you truly believe

103
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,520
I'd be that foolish

104
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,560
to risk my own life?

105
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,560
What's wrong?

106
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,360
There's poison in the tea.

107
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,080
Xu Ziyi tried to kill me.

108
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,440
Xu Ziyi

109
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,960
dared harm Prince Rui's heir?

110
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,120
Didn't you expect this?

111
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,480
How could this happen?

112
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,400
Xu Ziyi went this far to harm me.

113
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,040
I'll use my own life

114
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,600
to force you to testify

115
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,200
everything Xu Ziyi did to Lin Hong'er.

116
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,040
No, no! You wouldn't be that foolish.

117
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,240
W-Why were you so reckless?

118
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,400
How is she?

119
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,880
She's poisoned.

120
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,160
The child?

121
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,280
This poison is vicious.

122
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Not just the child,

123
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,520
even the mother may not survive.

124
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
She's meticulous,

125
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,000
always one step ahead of everyone.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,040
Why would she risk her own life?

127
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,440
Yes.

128
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,200
Yes, she was right.

129
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,800
She counted on Shentu Yu

130
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,760
to bring her back.

131
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,520
It's him.

132
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
There must be a way
to contact Shentu Yu.

133
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,560
You're here all along?

134
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,104
What are you doing?

135
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,160
I won't let her die
in this filthy place.

136
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,840
You're lying.

137
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,760
She won't die.

138
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,880
Don't act sentimental.

139
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,520
What do you mean?

140
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,560
Registrar Han asked you to testify

141
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,120
to prove Xu Ziyi isn't Lin Hong'er.

142
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
But you refused,

143
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,320
letting her escape justice.

144
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,920
You clung to beauty

145
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,960
and were indecisive.

146
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,560
But she

147
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,280
suffered too much.

148
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,000
Her life was harsh.

149
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,840
You gave her an opportunity.

150
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,000
She chose death willingly.

151
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,480
I'll testify.

152
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,040
I will go testify.

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,320
I'll prove Xu Ziyi isn't Lin Hong'er.

154
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,600
I'll do

155
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,760
whatever you want me to do.

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,600
Save her.

157
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,160
Save her.

158
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,880
I beg you.

159
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
Please save her. I'm begging you.

160
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,000
I've administered acupuncture.

161
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,000
Her only chance to survive

162
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,000
depends on whether
she has a strong will to survive.

163
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
She'll die.

164
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,680
She can't be saved.

165
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,520
She...

166
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:15,923
(CONSTABLE)

167
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,400
What are you doing?

168
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,120
Summon the witness.

169
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,080
Might...

170
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,480
Power...

171
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm here to testify

172
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,800
that the accused woman here
is just Xu Ziyi,

173
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,040
one of the principal conspirators

174
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,800
who conspired with officials
to murder Lin Hong'er's parents,

175
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,680
and frame Lin Hong'er.

176
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,600
Outrageous!

177
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,560
No shouting in court!

178
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,120
Feigning madness.

179
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,720
Guards!

180
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,360
Take her away for interrogation.

181
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,880
Understood.

182
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:20,000
(County Office)

183
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,840
Your Highness.

184
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,680
You are...

185
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,160
I've been taking care of the gravesite
for Lady Hong'er.

186
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,440
Lady Hong is awake.

187
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:31,456
(Three months later)

188
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,480
Shentu Yu saved you again.

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,160
But do you still remember me

190
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
and this place?

191
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Of course, I do.

192
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,800
This is where we first met.

193
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,680
If I had stayed here back then,

194
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,360
being with you,

195
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,840
holding your hand...

196
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,920
They are here for me.

197
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,200
Greetings, Consort Hong.

198
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,480
Consort?

199
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,880
The County Princess found me.

200
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,240
Made me accept the decree.

201
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,120
I don't know

202
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,320
what scheme she is plotting.

203
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,880
I need to clarify past events

204
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,920
and uncover the truth behind.

205
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
Are you interested?

206
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,440
Your Highness.

207
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,480
Your Highness.

208
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,720
Your Highness.

209
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,440
I...

210
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,600
I've got something.

211
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,760
Your Highness,

212
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,200
I wonder if this secret

213
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,960
could bargain for my life?

214
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,440
Some secrets let people live.

215
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,160
Others

216
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,880
make them die.

217
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,160
Is that monster being held here?

218
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,240
Yes.

219
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,120
Take me to see him.

220
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,600
Your Highness,

221
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,360
it's dangerous.

222
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,200
I wasn't afraid when he was human.

223
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Now,

224
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,000
there's even less to fear.

225
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,880
The devil in the deepest cell
of Lai County Prison

226
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,880
is dying.

227
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,240
- Greetings, Consort Hong.
- Greetings, Consort Hong.

228
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,160
I think

229
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,360
death is no longer

230
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,680
a threat for you.

231
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,120
But those who helped

232
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,760
keep you alive...

233
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,280
You won't just watch

234
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,680
them die because of you, will you?

235
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,720
I never realized

236
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,360
that the current me

237
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,280
still has value to be exploited by you.

238
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,000
You're meaningless here

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,840
in the mansion.

240
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,720
You were pregnant,

241
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,200
and then lost the child.

242
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,400
To the outside world,

243
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,200
these events remain mysterious.

244
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,480
If I report this,

245
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,080
your life could be in danger
at any moment.

246
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,880
How the story gets told

247
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,640
is entirely up to me.

248
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,440
I suddenly realize

249
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,760
that if you were pregnant
with Xiao Xian's child

250
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,240
and claimed it's Prince Rui's...

251
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,160
Your Highness,

252
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,976
you...

253
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
You're insane.

255
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:25,680
