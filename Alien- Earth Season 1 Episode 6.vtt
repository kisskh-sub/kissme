[Boy Kavalier] "All children,
except one, grow up.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.667
They soon know that they will grow up,

01:18.500 --> 01:20.250
and the way Wendy knew was this.

01:24.667 --> 01:28.583
One day, when she was two years old,
she was playing in a garden."

"I suppose
she must have looked rather delightful,

01:39.875 --> 01:43.708
for Mrs. Darling
put her hand to her heart and cried,

01:43.792 --> 01:47.208
'Oh, why can't you remain
like this forever?'

01:54.625 --> 01:56.792
This was all that passed
between them on the subject,

01:56.875 --> 02:00.125
but henceforth,
Wendy knew that she must grow up.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.208
You always know after you're two.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.500
Two is the beginning of the end."

You sure she's safe?

02:55.583 --> 02:57.625
[Kirsh] She killed an adult male
single-handed.

02:57.708 --> 03:01.000
This one's a child behind three inches
of steel and tempered glass.

03:01.083 --> 03:02.875
Safe isn't always about bodies.

03:04.708 --> 03:08.875
So you're worried about what,
her intellect, her emotions?

03:12.708 --> 03:16.417
Smee told me that
he can go two years without recharging.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.792
What other maintenance
do they need, the hybrids?

03:19.875 --> 03:21.083
Why?

03:21.167 --> 03:23.667
[stutters] I'm saying…

03:23.750 --> 03:28.208
one day, she's gonna graduate,
right, from this place,

03:28.292 --> 03:31.625
and when she does, she's gonna need
someone to take care of her.

03:33.042 --> 03:36.333
That's like an onion asking,
"How do I take care of a star?"

03:40.833 --> 03:42.083
Fine. Sure.

03:42.167 --> 03:45.417
You think
he's gonna let you take her with you?

03:46.167 --> 03:47.208
No. Uh…

03:48.042 --> 03:49.042
Maybe.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
To do what?

03:54.250 --> 03:55.250
Live.

03:56.667 --> 03:57.667
Be a family.

04:02.250 --> 04:06.583
Your sister has potential
to invent faster than light travel

04:06.667 --> 04:09.083
and explore the stars
for thousands of years,

04:09.583 --> 04:12.625
and you want her to be a family?

04:15.375 --> 04:16.417
She's just a kid.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.208
Keep telling yourself that.

[Arthur] Like I said, it's not mechanical.

04:53.833 --> 04:54.833
Is she…

04:56.250 --> 04:58.250
I have her in charging mode.
She can't hear us.

05:00.083 --> 05:02.417
-So what did she say exactly?
-[Dame Sylvia sighs]

05:03.292 --> 05:05.000
She said she was pregnant.

05:06.583 --> 05:07.583
Pregnant.

05:09.125 --> 05:12.125
-[Dame Sylvia] She's had a traumatic--
-Is that what I'm supposed to tell him?

05:12.208 --> 05:13.708
She's always been emotional.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.125
[chuckles] You remember.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.292
I thought we adjusted for that.

05:18.375 --> 05:21.333
We did, in the architecture…

05:23.125 --> 05:24.750
just not enough, clearly.

05:28.583 --> 05:29.583
So how do we fix her?

05:33.167 --> 05:35.833
In time, with enough therapy.

05:38.583 --> 05:39.583
No.

05:39.667 --> 05:40.667
[Dame Sylvia] Look, she's…

05:41.250 --> 05:45.542
As I said, there's trauma in her past.
We knew that when we chose her.

05:46.542 --> 05:48.792
I can help her. I just need time.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.792
No. You're going in.

05:54.458 --> 05:58.125
Reset her to before the tower.
Full memory wipe.

05:59.208 --> 06:02.958
Then I want you to dial back her reactions
to stimulus, slow her processing speed.

06:03.042 --> 06:05.292
You're talking about
fundamentally altering her personality.

06:05.375 --> 06:06.958
That's against every principle
of the program.

06:07.042 --> 06:08.417
[Atom Eins] Don't be dramatic.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.958
You said it yourself.
She's a child in distress.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.042
We're helping her.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.500
You should be grateful we have the tools.

06:17.667 --> 06:20.875
We don't know what impact
this would have on her identity,

06:21.708 --> 06:23.667
on her functioning psychology.

06:24.292 --> 06:25.583
We could be making it worse.

06:25.667 --> 06:26.958
[Atom Eins] Listen to me, both of you.

06:27.042 --> 06:30.750
This unit is going
to be smiling and waving from the stage

06:30.833 --> 06:31.875
three weeks from now.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.542
And when the information architects
of The Five

06:34.625 --> 06:37.875
talk to her over canapes and cocktails,

06:37.958 --> 06:43.792
I want her to be calm and charming,
just like the others.

06:44.292 --> 06:45.958
We've come too far to fail now

06:46.042 --> 06:48.375
just because you don't have the stomach
to bring this home.

06:48.458 --> 06:49.458
I won-I won't do it.

06:51.333 --> 06:52.542
Excuse me?

06:53.375 --> 06:54.625
We'll do it.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.875
No, wait, wait. Are you… Are you kidding?

06:59.958 --> 07:02.750
[Atom Eins] Your husband has qualms.
Can you do it yourself?

07:02.833 --> 07:03.833
[Arthur] No.

07:04.583 --> 07:05.583
Yes.

07:06.792 --> 07:07.875
[Atom Eins] Good.

07:08.750 --> 07:09.750
Then do it.

07:10.417 --> 07:11.417
You're fired.

07:13.542 --> 07:16.083
-[Arthur] Whoa. Hold on.
-[Dame Sylvia] You can't be serious.

07:16.167 --> 07:17.417
Absolutely.

07:18.208 --> 07:19.917
You disobeyed a direct order.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.250
Ah, you need me.

07:21.333 --> 07:24.250
[Atom Eins] No more it seems.
So pack your things.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.583
You can take the rest of the day
to organize your transport.

07:26.667 --> 07:29.583
If you're still on the island at
the end of the day, you'll be trespassing.

07:30.625 --> 07:31.708
And you may be shot.

07:51.667 --> 07:52.750
[chuckles]

07:52.833 --> 07:55.500
-That was amazing.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

07:56.292 --> 07:59.583
The pronunciation is a bit tricky,
but I'll get it.

08:02.667 --> 08:04.875
I'm gonna… I'm gonna
be honest with you, uh…

08:07.417 --> 08:09.458
I think it was a mistake
bringing them here. [stammers]

08:09.542 --> 08:11.542
Species from other worlds,

08:12.042 --> 08:14.042
-millions of years old.
-Hmm.

08:14.125 --> 08:16.625
Do you know how lucky we are
they didn't escape in the crash?

08:17.125 --> 08:18.458
They didn't ask to come here.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.375
Don't do that.

08:21.833 --> 08:26.000
You-You give them thoughts and feelings.
They're killers.

08:27.792 --> 08:28.875
So are we.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.125
Not like that.

08:32.458 --> 08:35.583
We've got brains, you know?
We… We think. We…

08:35.667 --> 08:36.667
Hmm.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.042
We have community.

08:39.708 --> 08:45.417
They survive, eat, sleep, maybe.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.208
-That's it.
-Mmm.

08:50.458 --> 08:51.458
Bees do that.

08:52.667 --> 08:53.917
Ants do that.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.417
They have hives, systems, whole colonies.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.042
It tried to kill us.

09:00.042 --> 09:01.042
Not this one.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.750
Joe, I think this one could be good.

09:04.833 --> 09:05.875
Marcy.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.917
This is a "yes" place. Not a "no" place.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.583
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

09:16.625 --> 09:20.125
[Wendy] The boy genius said that "no"
is the first step to nothing.

09:20.208 --> 09:25.667
Being nothing. Achieving nothing.
And here we say, "yes."

09:25.750 --> 09:28.292
If someone tries to take advantage
of you, tries to hurt you,

09:28.375 --> 09:31.958
then… then "no" gives you power.

09:32.042 --> 09:34.583
It gives you power over your body.
Power over your life.

09:41.542 --> 09:42.958
We don't have to talk about this.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.167
Not today.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.875
It has been a crazy few days.

09:50.917 --> 09:52.292
I'm so proud of you. I…

09:53.250 --> 09:55.167
I can't imagine
how hard all this has been.

09:57.375 --> 09:59.833
It's not gonna be forever. I promise.

10:02.292 --> 10:04.000
I'm working out a way
to get us out of here.

10:07.333 --> 10:08.500
What if I don't want to go?

The moderator assigned to you
by the governing collective

11:11.500 --> 11:13.667
known as The Five.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.625
As agreed upon by your corporations,

11:15.708 --> 11:17.167
the decision I reach

11:17.250 --> 11:21.000
after hearing evidence and arguments
will be legally binding.

11:21.958 --> 11:24.625
Mr. Kavalier, Ms. Yutani,

11:25.333 --> 11:29.375
I expect
you will comport yourselves professionally

11:29.458 --> 11:32.208
as these are professional matters.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.208
Ms. Yutani,
I will now hear your opening statement.

11:36.292 --> 11:39.083
Let me start by listing the facts
that are not in dispute.

11:39.750 --> 11:42.292
First, the USCSS Maginot

11:42.375 --> 11:45.458
is a Science Class research vessel
owned and operated

11:45.542 --> 11:47.375
by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.

11:47.458 --> 11:50.292
This means
that all data, equipment, personnel,

11:50.375 --> 11:55.167
and research materials on board
are the sole property of Weyland-Yutani.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.917
Seizure and retention of these items is--

11:57.000 --> 11:58.625
-Sorry, can I… can I--
-No.

11:58.708 --> 12:00.125
-Your ship…
-Wait your turn.

12:00.208 --> 12:02.792
…didn't just crash in the abstract.

12:02.875 --> 12:05.875
It destroyed three blocks of my city,
killing and injuring thousands.

12:05.958 --> 12:06.958
[McAfee] Mr. Kavalier,

12:07.042 --> 12:10.667
you will have a chance to speak,
but this is Ms. Yutani's time.

12:10.750 --> 12:14.333
Yeah, look, I don't know how things are
done here in… [snores] …bureaucracy-ville,

12:14.417 --> 12:18.167
but in the future, where I live,
we move fast, and we make trillions.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.875
I'll compare our earnings to yours
any day.

12:19.958 --> 12:23.792
As I mentioned at the onset,
this is a professional hearing,

12:23.875 --> 12:26.167
and you will conduct yourselves
professionally.

12:26.250 --> 12:27.458
[chuckles] Or what?

12:27.542 --> 12:29.708
Or he'll send you to bed
without your supper, little boy.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.625
Mr. Kavalier, do you dispute
the facts listed by Ms. Yutani?

12:33.708 --> 12:36.083
What, that it's her ship? Yeah, sure.

12:36.167 --> 12:37.208
She can have it back

12:37.292 --> 12:40.500
as soon as I figure out how to remove it
from my building without knocking it over.

12:41.042 --> 12:42.792
And the materials onboard?

12:44.125 --> 12:46.292
Well, let me ask you something.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.083
What if it wasn't an accident?

12:50.833 --> 12:51.917
-What?
-[Boy Kavalier] Yeah.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.542
I'm saying maybe it was an attack.

12:54.625 --> 12:57.750
Or maybe the pilot was drunk, or maybe
the ship was so poorly maintained

12:57.833 --> 12:59.625
that the crash
is a matter of criminal negligence,

12:59.708 --> 13:01.583
which would make her the criminal
and me the victim.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.375
Oh, no, here's a better word. The cop.

13:03.458 --> 13:06.792
Because now it's my job to figure out
why so many of my citizens are dead.

13:06.875 --> 13:09.750
Believe me, we are already
well into investigating what--

13:09.833 --> 13:13.583
If you think I'm gonna let you investigate
your own crash, honey, you're crazy.

13:14.625 --> 13:19.167
I already told you, you will be more than
well-compensated for the damage done.

13:19.250 --> 13:24.833
It's not about money! I mean, I've got…
Honey, I've got money. This is a cover-up.

13:26.125 --> 13:28.292
Do you know
what she's so desperate to get back?

13:29.833 --> 13:31.792
Deep-space biological specimen.

13:33.333 --> 13:37.208
Yeah, invasive species, predatory

13:38.042 --> 13:41.042
that Weyland-Yutani
was smuggling onto the planet

13:41.625 --> 13:45.333
in direct violation
of, like, 50 intercorporate laws.

13:46.167 --> 13:48.417
-Untrue.
-Oh. Do you wanna see the pictures?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.208
Wait.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.417
These are proprietary specimens

13:53.917 --> 13:56.958
meant to be studied
at an off-planet research facility.

13:57.042 --> 13:58.625
Which is where they will be transferred to

13:58.708 --> 14:01.667
the moment Mr. Kavalier
stops holding them hostage.

14:02.167 --> 14:07.167
And yet you can understand
Mr. Kavalier's position.

14:07.250 --> 14:08.917
Which is why we are willing to add

14:09.000 --> 14:15.625
an additional $10 billion to
the settlement for his pain and suffering.

14:15.708 --> 14:16.750
[Boy Kavalier] Twenty.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.000
Fifteen.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.250
Twenty-five.

14:24.917 --> 14:26.125
Twenty it is.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.500
[McAfee] Are we agreed then?

14:29.375 --> 14:32.250
-Yeah. Yeah, we are. [chuckles]
-Yes.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.167
Okay, I'll, uh, box them up
and send them back…

14:36.333 --> 14:38.042
you know,
as soon as the quarantine's over.

14:39.917 --> 14:41.000
-No.
-[Boy Kavalier] Yeah.

14:41.083 --> 14:44.458
Six weeks is the established precedent
for off-world quarantine.

14:44.542 --> 14:45.750
Isn't that right?

14:46.583 --> 14:49.375
That is
what the Brubaker Accord established.

14:53.458 --> 14:57.792
Fifty billion,
and we take possession immediately.

15:01.458 --> 15:07.292
It's just not safe, you know?
For the planet. [sighs]

15:09.292 --> 15:10.917
They don't belong to you.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.625
Well, they're living creatures. I mean,
technically they don't belong to anyone.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.417
Okay, I assume we're done here.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.125
It's 20 billion
on top of practical damages,

15:21.208 --> 15:23.958
and we'll return the specimens
at the end of legal quarantine.

15:24.042 --> 15:29.125
And of course, your thoughts and prayers

15:29.833 --> 15:35.042
for all the victims of the Maginot crash
are always welcome.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.542
On behalf of The Five,

15:51.458 --> 15:54.792
let me just say how pleased I am
we could come to an amenable--

15:54.875 --> 15:56.208
-Oh, shut up.
-[Boy Kavalier] Whoo!

15:58.083 --> 15:59.083
[door closes]

16:07.500 --> 16:08.500
[door closes]

16:12.833 --> 16:13.833
Where are we?

16:14.708 --> 16:16.792
I could have one of the Xenomorphs
by the end of the day.

16:17.958 --> 16:20.250
-Could?
-It's a recruited asset.

16:20.333 --> 16:21.917
There's a strong potential for failure.

16:23.250 --> 16:26.333
And you should know that
Prodigy's increased its on-island security

16:26.417 --> 16:28.375
substantially in the last 24 hours.

16:29.042 --> 16:31.125
Most likely
an expectation of a frontal assault.

16:31.708 --> 16:32.708
What do you recommend?

16:36.875 --> 16:39.792
We destabilize the facility,
and exfil in the chaos.

16:46.917 --> 16:48.917
[footsteps retreating]

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
[elevator chimes]

17:17.875 --> 17:18.875
Look at you.

17:21.375 --> 17:25.250
The almost human. Self-hating machine.

17:26.667 --> 17:28.083
How you must envy me.

17:28.167 --> 17:32.417
Sure. Yesterday's model,
the incredibly relevant robot.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.125
Who wouldn't want to be you?

17:36.208 --> 17:38.833
What's it like working for a company
that's made you obsolete?

17:40.333 --> 17:42.167
I don't know what you're talking about.

17:42.250 --> 17:46.208
They're cute, your kids
with their shiny new bodies.

17:46.292 --> 17:47.667
I gotta get me one of those.

17:49.375 --> 17:52.417
A child or a body that isn't so sad?

17:55.708 --> 17:58.875
You know what I like most
about killing synths?

17:59.917 --> 18:01.125
They don't feel pain.

18:01.750 --> 18:05.083
So nothing clouds their minds
when I start chopping them up.

18:07.708 --> 18:08.708
See,

18:09.208 --> 18:12.542
I would imagine it's the pain
that makes it satisfying.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.625
Especially for Cyborgs.

18:16.417 --> 18:19.917
That moment when you realize
you're not a machine after all,

18:21.667 --> 18:24.583
when the first eyeball pops.

18:26.250 --> 18:27.333
[elevator chimes]

18:29.458 --> 18:31.875
I'll see you soon, old toy.

18:51.833 --> 18:53.042
[sighs]

18:53.542 --> 18:57.042
Just a few adjustments, sweetheart, okay?

18:58.250 --> 18:59.333
Isn't that a gift?

19:02.167 --> 19:05.083
To be able to remove the trauma.

19:16.167 --> 19:17.250
[speaks indistinctly]

19:23.708 --> 19:25.333
[grunting, groaning]

19:37.000 --> 19:41.292
Just… a little bit longer, okay?

19:57.167 --> 19:58.167
Hi.

19:59.125 --> 20:00.375
Hi. [chuckles]

20:01.458 --> 20:04.292
You… You feeling better?

20:05.917 --> 20:06.917
Better?

20:07.708 --> 20:09.500
Better than what? I feel fine.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.208
Normal, I guess.

20:14.208 --> 20:17.167
I feel like I slept
for a thousand years though. [sighs]

20:17.250 --> 20:18.667
-[beeps]
-[sighs]

20:20.667 --> 20:21.667
What's up?

20:23.083 --> 20:24.208
Well, I thought…

20:27.417 --> 20:29.667
You said you were gonna have a baby.

20:31.042 --> 20:32.167
Yeah, right.

20:33.458 --> 20:34.458
When?

20:36.917 --> 20:37.958
Oh, a few days ago.

20:38.958 --> 20:41.000
Uh, Curly told me that you said…

20:42.250 --> 20:46.000
A few days ago we were
in the training room and we had that hike.

20:47.667 --> 20:50.500
No, when Slightly and Smee got back
from the crash.

20:52.458 --> 20:53.458
The what?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.250
The crash? [chuckles]

20:56.750 --> 21:00.167
In the city? And you saw
all the animals in the broken zoo.

21:01.875 --> 21:02.875
Stop funnin'.

21:03.875 --> 21:06.333
The scariest thing I remember
from a few days ago

21:07.333 --> 21:08.958
is ghost stories and flashlights.

21:11.292 --> 21:12.500
No, that was…

21:14.708 --> 21:15.750
What's wrong with you?

21:17.667 --> 21:19.292
Nothing. What's wrong with you?

21:22.333 --> 21:24.542
[Wendy] We went to the city, Nibs.

21:26.333 --> 21:27.625
And the ship was crashed.

21:28.208 --> 21:30.750
We had to go through
and save all these people.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.292
And you… you found the eye.

21:36.458 --> 21:37.542
It really scared you.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.333
Stop it.

21:43.042 --> 21:44.500
Stop what?

21:46.125 --> 21:47.417
I don't have any of that.

21:52.083 --> 21:54.667
What's wrong with me?
I don't have any of that.

21:57.125 --> 21:58.250
Well, it's okay.

22:00.417 --> 22:02.333
It's okay. I'm sure you'll get it back.

22:05.833 --> 22:08.250
You do remember going
with Arthur and Dame Sylvia?

22:10.667 --> 22:11.667
When?

22:12.667 --> 22:16.917
Well, after you said
you were gonna have a baby. They…

22:30.250 --> 22:33.167
[Boy Kavalier] "While she slept,
she had a dream.

22:35.458 --> 22:38.667
She dreamt
that the Neverland had come too near.

22:39.625 --> 22:42.000
And that a strange boy
had broken through from it.

22:45.167 --> 22:48.042
He did not alarm her,
for she thought she had seen him before

22:48.125 --> 22:50.417
in the faces of many women
who have no children.

22:54.458 --> 22:58.583
Perhaps he is to be found
in the faces of some mothers also.

22:59.708 --> 23:03.958
But in her dream, he had rent the film
that obscures the Neverland.

23:05.292 --> 23:08.083
And she saw Wendy and John and Michael…"

23:08.167 --> 23:10.417
[Slightly] I know I can.
I just know I can. I need to find him.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.000
[Boy Kavalier] "…peeping through the gap."

23:12.083 --> 23:13.417
[Slightly] No… I…

23:14.542 --> 23:17.833
I… know. I know. I know.

23:17.917 --> 23:20.167
I know, I know.
I know I can. I just need to…

23:21.083 --> 23:22.083
Just leave me alone!

23:22.167 --> 23:23.167
[Smee] Hey.

23:24.417 --> 23:26.208
-Are-Are you okay?
-[Slightly] I'm fine.

23:27.792 --> 23:29.167
[Smee] We're still friends though, right?

23:29.250 --> 23:31.708
Dude, please, I just need
to take care of this stuff, all right?

23:32.833 --> 23:37.250
Ugh. Man, everybody's so cranky here.
It's not fun anymore.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.333
[Slightly] 'Cause not everything's
supposed to be fun.

23:41.417 --> 23:43.292
We-We're grown-ups now.

23:46.167 --> 23:47.333
Being grown-up sucks.

23:50.083 --> 23:52.417
Yeah. Big time.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.667
Can't-Can't we just… I don't know…

23:57.667 --> 24:01.125
-No, I… I've got all this--
-[Smee] Stuff to do. I know.

24:02.583 --> 24:03.750
-[Slightly] Hey, Smee.
-[Smee] No.

24:04.250 --> 24:05.250
[Slightly] Listen.

24:06.708 --> 24:08.917
[sighs] Look, let me… let me…
let me just take care of this stuff,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.833
and I promise later on we can play
all the games you want. [sighs]

24:16.542 --> 24:17.958
Really?

24:19.792 --> 24:20.792
Yeah.

24:25.292 --> 24:26.458
[Slightly sighs]

24:34.958 --> 24:35.958
What are you doing?

24:37.417 --> 24:38.958
Just giving you a grown-up hug.

24:40.208 --> 24:41.375
[both chuckle]

24:45.625 --> 24:46.708
[TV playing, indistinct]

25:08.417 --> 25:09.417
-Hey.
-Hi.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.500
[Hermit] Have you seen Marcy?

25:11.833 --> 25:13.208
No, I haven't seen her.

25:13.833 --> 25:14.833
[Hermit] Okay.

25:16.167 --> 25:18.667
We could… We could go look for her, maybe?

25:19.250 --> 25:20.333
I'm sure she'll turn up.

25:20.917 --> 25:22.083
[chuckles]

25:26.417 --> 25:27.417
Remind me…

25:29.125 --> 25:30.292
what was your name before?

25:31.125 --> 25:32.125
[Morrow] Aarush.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.125
You have to hurry.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.667
I can't.

25:37.458 --> 25:41.042
Oh. If that's not something
you can talk about, I understand.

25:42.125 --> 25:45.375
[Morrow] Say it,
"You need to come with me."

25:48.833 --> 25:51.042
It's just unfair, you know?

25:53.125 --> 25:57.917
You know, like, Wendy
gets to see her family, but what do I get?

26:01.458 --> 26:03.375
We will talk to them, I promise.

26:08.458 --> 26:09.458
Hey, can I, uh…

26:12.000 --> 26:13.167
I want to show you something.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.708
-Uh… What?
-[Slightly] It-It's secret.

26:21.292 --> 26:22.500
I…

26:22.583 --> 26:23.750
Come on, it'll be fun.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.208
-[knocks on door]
-[Rashidi] Hey.

26:27.875 --> 26:30.500
Uh, patrol is short a man. Wanna come?

26:30.583 --> 26:32.542
No. [chuckles] That's rude.

26:32.625 --> 26:33.625
We were just gonna…

26:34.500 --> 26:35.667
It-It won't take long.

26:35.750 --> 26:36.875
We'll talk when I'm back, okay?

26:36.958 --> 26:38.667
[Slightly] No, no, we need to go now.

26:38.750 --> 26:41.542
It's, uh… It's-It's for Wendy.

26:42.875 --> 26:47.417
Sorry, kid, it's my fault.
Orders from above. Security issue.

26:48.750 --> 26:51.792
We'll, uh… We'll bring him back
as soon as possible, all right?

26:57.792 --> 26:58.958
What the hell was that about?

26:59.042 --> 27:00.333
I have no idea.

27:01.292 --> 27:04.500
All right, Q's this way.
Let's get you geared up.

27:21.208 --> 27:25.083
[Siberian] I'd rather be out here
with the bugs, lizards and slugs.

27:25.583 --> 27:28.833
Suits me fine. Scary shit's in that lab.

27:30.292 --> 27:31.625
What, you mean the monsters?

27:32.625 --> 27:35.917
Or one of those freaky-ass robots
having a malfunction, all…

27:36.000 --> 27:38.250
[mimicking mechanical noises]

27:39.042 --> 27:41.083
Sorry, man. Sorry.

27:43.667 --> 27:46.875
Is that really your sister?
In that machine?

27:47.667 --> 27:48.667
Yeah.

27:50.083 --> 27:51.125
I think so.

27:52.667 --> 27:53.708
She is to me, anyway.

27:56.292 --> 27:58.083
I heard Yutani's pissed.

27:58.917 --> 28:01.542
Might send some of her Cyborgs
to get her monsters back.

28:02.167 --> 28:05.000
That's why we're here patrolling.
Got to be on alert.

28:05.083 --> 28:07.750
We're on an island
in the middle of fucking nowhere.

28:07.833 --> 28:09.333
No way on, no way off.

28:10.083 --> 28:11.667
This is just to keep us busy.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.583
There's gotta be some way off, right?

28:14.125 --> 28:16.417
[Rashidi] Some airships, couple boats.

28:17.042 --> 28:18.917
Are we close enough
to the mainland for boats?

28:19.625 --> 28:20.875
I don't know about that,

28:21.917 --> 28:24.417
but keep down this path
and you'll see a sign for boat docks.

28:25.792 --> 28:28.583
It's not like you can just get
a weekend pass though. [chuckles]

28:29.708 --> 28:31.375
Everything is under strict control.

28:32.833 --> 28:34.750
By our people? People we know?

28:35.333 --> 28:39.250
[Rashidi] Nah. Island has
its own security. We're just…

28:39.333 --> 28:42.667
We're the muscle, the help, whatever.

28:43.542 --> 28:44.792
We're expendable.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.375
You know, my dad took me on a boat once.
It was a long time ago.

28:53.750 --> 28:55.833
You guys, you grow up around boats?

28:55.917 --> 28:56.917
Stop.

28:57.417 --> 28:58.417
[Hermit] Stop what?

28:58.500 --> 29:02.792
Whatever you're planning.
Asking about boats, how far we are.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.375
We got a good thing going here.

29:04.458 --> 29:07.458
We're alive. We get paid.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Don't fuck it up.

29:14.917 --> 29:16.125
The monsters are here.

29:16.792 --> 29:19.750
[Siberian] Maybe.
But if I'm here, at least I know.

29:20.417 --> 29:21.417
Know what?

29:23.208 --> 29:24.208
Where they are.

29:37.042 --> 29:41.042
-[Wendy screeching]
-[creature humming, rattling]

29:52.958 --> 29:54.917
[rattling]

30:07.750 --> 30:11.875
[chitters]

30:12.583 --> 30:16.083
[rattling]

30:18.875 --> 30:21.458
[rattling continues]

30:35.500 --> 30:36.500
[clicks]

30:38.958 --> 30:40.042
[Tootles] Hello?

30:40.125 --> 30:41.375
Are you in the lab?

30:42.292 --> 30:44.917
Uh. No. Uh, you left, so…

30:45.000 --> 30:47.042
[Kirsh] I had to fly to the mainland
for a few hours.

30:47.125 --> 30:50.875
There was a meeting with Yutani.
I should be back by dark.

30:51.375 --> 30:52.958
Okay. Uh, what do you need me to do?

30:53.708 --> 30:55.875
[Kirsh] The creatures need to be fed
and watered.

30:56.625 --> 31:01.208
Check the data from last night, and
pick the next experiment from the list.

31:02.458 --> 31:03.750
Is Curly with you?

31:04.667 --> 31:06.167
-Uh…
-[Curly] That was a big splash.

31:07.167 --> 31:09.375
No. But I can handle it.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.750
Step-by-step.
Follow protocols to the letter.

31:14.250 --> 31:17.333
The scientific method is a method,
not a suggestion box.

31:18.292 --> 31:19.292
I got it.

31:21.083 --> 31:22.292
Um…

31:22.375 --> 31:23.375
I have to go.

31:24.125 --> 31:26.708

-Should I come?

No. I got it.

37:01.417 --> 37:02.417
Wendy?

37:03.625 --> 37:04.833
[Wendy] What did you do to her?

37:08.375 --> 37:09.458
Who?

37:09.542 --> 37:10.542
[Wendy] Nibs.

37:11.583 --> 37:13.750
She doesn't remember
half the stuff we did this week.

37:13.833 --> 37:19.500
Not the crash, not the fighting,
that she said she was gonna have a baby.

37:19.583 --> 37:22.750
Well, darling, it's, uh…

37:24.875 --> 37:25.958
complicated.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.583
You know she was upset.

37:32.417 --> 37:37.958
We ran some diagnostics, and we found
a glitch in one of her subroutines.

37:38.667 --> 37:40.792
-The only way we could fix it--
-You made her forget.

37:43.792 --> 37:48.000
We removed the corrupt data
before it could corrupt the rest of her.

37:48.542 --> 37:49.542
[Wendy] That's a funny word.

37:52.500 --> 37:53.500
Corrupt.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.917
-[Dame Sylvia] It means--
-I know what it means. I'm not stupid.

37:58.875 --> 38:00.583
No. Of course not.

38:01.250 --> 38:03.958
I told him this was a "yes" place.

38:06.167 --> 38:07.750
You didn't give her a choice, did you?

38:09.708 --> 38:15.333
I gave her medicine,
just like any other doctor.

38:17.250 --> 38:21.792
Please, Wendy, I have
the utmost respect for you. All of you.

38:21.875 --> 38:23.083
Because we're special.

38:26.375 --> 38:27.417
Of course.

38:29.375 --> 38:30.375
You are.

38:31.375 --> 38:34.208
You have potential
beyond anything we imagined.

38:41.292 --> 38:46.333
You've been going to the secure lab
a lot lately, Kirsh told me.

38:47.042 --> 38:48.958
Someone has to watch.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.417
They didn't ask to come here.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.208
Well…

38:57.708 --> 39:01.042
They're specimens.
Collected by Weyland-Yutani.

39:01.125 --> 39:02.417
He's studying them.

39:04.167 --> 39:05.583
They're experiments to him.

39:06.792 --> 39:11.250
This is a research facility
filled with scientists.

39:11.333 --> 39:14.167
That's what we do. We study.

39:16.375 --> 39:17.458
Like you study us.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.500
Wendy.

39:21.583 --> 39:23.000
That's not my name.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.333
Marcy. Marcy, why don't we sit down--

39:32.417 --> 39:34.125
He said, "Stop pretending."

39:34.792 --> 39:39.542
I said,
"Are we people or are we something else?"

39:40.250 --> 39:44.417
And he said, "Stop pretending
to be people." And I think he's right.

39:47.167 --> 39:50.208
I don't want to be people anymore
if this is what people are.

39:52.292 --> 39:56.042
Killing things, taking them apart
just to see what's inside.

39:56.125 --> 39:57.625
-Who said?
-[Wendy] Kirsh.

39:58.583 --> 40:01.292
He said people get romantic about things.

40:03.042 --> 40:04.083
Feelings.

40:05.917 --> 40:07.042
But that we don't have to.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.458
We can get rid of all of that.

40:12.708 --> 40:14.042
All the sadness.

40:15.583 --> 40:16.625
All the madness.

40:19.125 --> 40:23.875
See the world for what it really is,
not how it feels.

40:26.833 --> 40:27.958
Well, he would say that.

40:30.583 --> 40:31.917
He's a machine.

40:33.583 --> 40:35.667
Marcy. Trust me.

40:36.708 --> 40:39.667
Everything we're doing here,
we do for you.

40:40.708 --> 40:44.208
My only job is to make sure
that nothing gets lost.

40:45.417 --> 40:47.417
Nibs got lost.

40:47.500 --> 40:50.542
No. We helped her.

40:52.708 --> 40:54.917
Are there going to be problems
in this transition?

40:55.000 --> 40:58.708
Of course. It's new technology.

40:58.792 --> 41:02.042
You're on a journey that no one's
ever taken before.

41:02.958 --> 41:04.250
But we're here.

41:05.417 --> 41:08.625
I'm here to help you.

41:10.083 --> 41:11.917
To make sure that you get through.

41:15.208 --> 41:17.333
But we have to work together, right?

41:18.792 --> 41:23.583
You have to tell me what's wrong,
so I can help you fix it.

41:29.458 --> 41:31.000
What if you're what's wrong?

42:24.417 --> 42:25.750
Hi.

42:25.833 --> 42:27.833
Joe, right? Or do you prefer Hermit?

42:28.875 --> 42:30.042
What are you doing?

42:30.125 --> 42:31.958
Oh, me? Nothing.

42:32.917 --> 42:36.125
Just getting out of here. Quick trip.
Not like I was fired or anything.

42:37.083 --> 42:38.083
They fired you?

42:39.500 --> 42:40.500
No.

42:41.083 --> 42:45.083
Oh. [stutters] Yes. But don't worry
about me. I have, like, six degrees.

42:45.583 --> 42:47.833
Sorry, did-did you want something?

42:48.417 --> 42:49.708
Yeah. I, uh…

42:52.750 --> 42:54.917
I noticed how you took care of Marcy…

42:56.542 --> 42:57.542
Wendy.

42:58.250 --> 42:59.417
When her hearing…

42:59.958 --> 43:04.583
Anyway, I noticed how you seem to care.

43:05.375 --> 43:09.208
Yeah, I did. I mean, I… I do.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.500
So, maybe I can ask you something
and you can give me an honest answer,

43:14.583 --> 43:17.083
and then maybe
I can just relax a little bit.

43:19.083 --> 43:21.667
Yeah. Well, most of what we do here
is pretty confidential,

43:21.750 --> 43:22.750
but I'll answer what I can.

43:22.833 --> 43:24.917
Is my sister safe here?

43:27.667 --> 43:28.667
Oh.

43:30.333 --> 43:33.167
Be honest. Please.

43:43.583 --> 43:44.958
[Arthur] Of course she is.

43:45.958 --> 43:47.875
As safe as a safe in a bank.

43:49.208 --> 43:52.417
And the missus and me do everything
we can to ensure the kids' well-being.

43:56.458 --> 43:59.250
Here, let me show you.
I can pop their vitals right here.

44:00.792 --> 44:01.792

44:06.792 --> 44:09.750
See, there's Smee. Looking healthy.

44:13.542 --> 44:15.917
And then there's Wendy.

44:19.125 --> 44:20.167
[Hermit] Yeah.

44:21.625 --> 44:22.625
-I see.
-Yeah?

44:25.167 --> 44:27.875
And look. Uh… [punches keys]

44:28.458 --> 44:33.625

Looking totally normal.

That's all the reassurances
I can give you.

45:02.250 --> 45:03.750
We do everything we can for them.

45:04.542 --> 45:06.958
Best care. All the time.

45:07.042 --> 45:09.958
Yeah. That's really all I needed to hear.

to watch his stuff, so…
