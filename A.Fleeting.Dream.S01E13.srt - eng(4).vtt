00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.040
I found this in Pei Yujie's study.

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:38.079
This might be
why he suddenly moved against us.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:39.559
Xinruo.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.200
I've known all along
it was Pei Yujie who killed my father.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.080
The only reason
I stayed by his side for so many years

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.639
was to earn his trust,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.120
and a chance to take revenge.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.879
After learning who you really were,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.759
I tried every way I could
to pass clues to you.

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:56.839
I treated you badly.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:58.999
That was my fault.

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.639
I hope you can forgive me.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.960
Don't say that.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.079
If anything, we should be thanking you.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.318
If it weren't for you,

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.239
we'd never have found the tungsten ore.

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.799
One more thing.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.358
When we cleaned up the scene,

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.439
we didn't find Wu Peirong's body.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.199
You mean...

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.720
Wu Peirong might still be alive?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.400
I'm not sure.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.038
But don't worry.

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.319
Even if he is alive,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.440
I'll keep you safe.

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.599
Jiang Yao.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.000
What happened between us...

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.640
is in the past.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.358
We were young then,

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.038
and didn't understand what love was.

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.399
Now that you have Xueshan,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.440
you should cherish her.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.280
Protect her.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.598
I need to get some food for Yuze.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.959
I'll go now.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.959
You've been sick for so long,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.838
you shouldn't eat anything too heavy.

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:13.719
Start with some soup. Here.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.640
Just drink your soup.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.360
Why do you keep staring at me?

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.439
Pei Yuze, I'm warning you.

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.319
This is a hospital.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.479
Stop with those messy thoughts
and behavior you always have.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.439
And what do you think I'm thinking?

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.400
I...

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.119
Let's talk business.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.879
I mentioned your poisoning
at the warehouse that day.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.560
But Pei Yujie's reacted
as if he knew nothing about it.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.000
I noticed that too.

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.879
He admitted to every crime,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.800
except that one.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.200
If it really wasn't him,

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.999
then anyone who entered
the Pei family back then is a suspect.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.159
But time is running out,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
and we don't have the slightest lead.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.120
I'm at a loss here.

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.519
Don't worry.

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:24.598
Bad weeds live long.

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.319
I won't die that easily.

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:31.719
And I won't let you die, bad weed.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.060
(Pei Residence)

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.720
(Memorial)

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.340
(In memory of Beloved Father Pei Yujie)

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:11.679
Move aside.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.719
Uncles.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.000
Why are you here?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.719
Pei Yujie committed treason for money.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.318
He ruined the Pei family's name.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.919
Now he's dead,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.038
but the Pei family has become
rats everyone wants to kill.

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.118
I'm here today

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:29.838
to demand, on behalf of the family
and our branches, that we split up.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.999
Third Uncle, this is a funeral hall.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.199
Show some restraint.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.999
Shut your mouth. You're an outsider.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.399
Do not meddle in our family business.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.879
You...

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.759
Yao!

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.840
Calm down.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.400
Uncles.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.399
I'm not only my father's daughter.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.960
I'm also part of the Pei family.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.598
Of course I don't want us
to bring ruin to the family.

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.919
But the reason
we've had such prestige until now

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.919
is because
everyone in the family stood united,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.320
supporting one another.

00:05:54.359 --> 00:05:56.999
If we break apart
over a moment's hardship,

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:58.679
without the family's backing,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.919
our shops will be swallowed up

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.480
sooner or later.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.679
My father may have acted without honor,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.199
but he ran
the Pei family for many years.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.560
His ability spoke for itself.

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.078
Yao was the heir
my father trained with care.

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.359
His skill and courage are
no less than my father's.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.880
I ask all of you to give us some time,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.120
so Yao can prove he's able
to shoulder this family's duty.

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:26.719
Second Uncle, Xinruo.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.280
My father did many wrongs in his life,

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.360
even bringing ruin to the Lian family.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.960
I'm making this decision on my own.

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.118
I'll return
the Lian family's assets to Miss Lian.

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:40.799
And I'll gift her
several of my own properties

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.440
to atone for my father's sins.

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:44.159
Xinruo,

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:47.759
can you forgive us
for Second Uncle's sake?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.959
What happened back then
wasn't your fault.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.840
Don't worry,
I won't hold it against you.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.440
What do you all think?

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.800
Then, we'll give you three months.

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:06.199
Let Jiang Yao act
as head of the family for now.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.798
If he can't restored

00:07:07.799 --> 00:07:10.079
the family's reputation
in three months,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.040
then we'll have to choose another head.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:14.479
Let's go.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.000
Thank you, Third Granduncle.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.180
(Pei Residence)

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:47.639
What's wrong?

00:07:49.799 --> 00:07:50.999
Nothing.

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:54.759
Just this uneasy feeling I can't shake.

00:07:56.359 --> 00:07:59.639
You've noticed something strange
about Pei Xueshan too, haven't you?

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.120
I have.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.200
But I can't quite
put my finger on what it is.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.600
Try looking at it another way.

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:14.559
If you were Pei Xueshan,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.440
and your father

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.479
was killed right before your eyes,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.718
even if it was revenge for a murder,

00:08:21.719 --> 00:08:24.159
wouldn't you resent the killer?

00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:26.639
I can understand her actions,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.358
but I'd never easily forgive

00:08:29.359 --> 00:08:31.079
someone who hurt my loved ones.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:36.240
And yet, her kindness toward me
feels far too much.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.360
With just a few words,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.920
she sent the elders
demanding a split away.

00:08:43.199 --> 00:08:45.999
She cleared the way
for Jiang Yao to become acting head,

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:48.319
and returned the Lian family's assets,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.440
winning over the second branch.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:54.959
She is nowhere near
as simple as she looks.

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:06.719
Second Uncle, you look much better.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.039
Yao, did you
come to see me for something?

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.200
Yes. I wanted to talk about Xinruo.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.720
Xinruo?

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.520
You should be calling her Second Aunt.

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:22.999
No need to provoke me, Uncle.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.638
I know you only pretended
to be engaged out of necessity.

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:28.358
Now that Xinruo has avenged her family,

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:31.759
you and she should both
return to your proper places.

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:37.359
You really are clever in your own mind.

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:39.239
Go on.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.960
I hope you'll announce
the end of your engagement with her.

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:45.359
She shouldn't have to live

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.600
the rest of her life as your widow.

00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:54.439
Yao,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.280
tell me something.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.600
In what capacity
are you discussing this with me?

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:01.599
Xinruo must have told you

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:03.599
my feud with Pei Yujie

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.718
and how Xinruo and I
were forced apart back then.

00:10:05.719 --> 00:10:08.359
But I know neither of us
ever forgot the other.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.319
Uncle, I can see you care for Xinruo.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.959
But your days are numbered.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.120
You can't give her a future.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.759
Instead of keeping her bound

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.359
for your own selfishness,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.880
let her go free.

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:26.199
I see now.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.200
You got engaged
to Xueshan for the headship.

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:32.599
Now that you're about to take power,

00:10:33.319 --> 00:10:35.439
you want Xinruo too.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:38.039
So, you're acting like the family head,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.000
ordering me to end the engagement.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.960
So when I'm gone,

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:43.919
you can enjoy both women.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.798
Uncle,

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:46.559
that's not what I meant.

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.199
Isn't it?

00:10:48.719 --> 00:10:50.519
You know the truth yourself.

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:58.279
Do you want to know

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.880
if Xinruo truly has me in her heart?

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:06.039
Yuze, what's wrong?

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.158
Are you feeling unwell?

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:07.879
I'm fine.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.720
But you're coughing so hard!

00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:12.239
Help me.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.519
What are you waiting for?
Help me get him to his room.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.600
Right.

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:16.559
Come on.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.120
Careful.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.959
I'll get you some water.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.080
Excuse me.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.360
I told you.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.479
You can't beat me.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.480
You...

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.319
Here's your water.

00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:41.638
Take your medicine.

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:42.959
Where do you keep it?

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.200
It's fine.

00:11:44.719 --> 00:11:46.679
I just need to rest.

00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:48.838
Xinruo, don't let him fool you!

00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:50.359
He's faking it.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.320
Jiang Yao.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.559
Get out.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.359
Pei Yuze, you vile man.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.199
Stand up!

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.399
Jiang Yao!

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:03.639
We'll talk outside.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.159
Xinruo, don't believe him.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.079
He's pretending

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.839
and alienating us.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.039
He's not sick at all.

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:18.519
Yao, Yuze is weak.

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:20.439
Don't agitate him again.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.919
Xinruo, no, he is...

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.880
Forget it.

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:25.679
Go handle your business.

00:12:42.239 --> 00:12:43.999
Are you feeling better?

00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:46.798
Much better. Don't worry.

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:48.039
If that's the case,

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.479
then I'll go talk with Yao a bit more.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.519
You get some rest.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.560
Wait.

00:12:54.239 --> 00:12:55.519
Why did you stop acting?

00:12:55.799 --> 00:12:56.838
Are you a child?

00:12:56.839 --> 00:12:58.399
How could you pretend to be sick?

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.640
I was wrong.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.840
Do you know how worried I was?

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.158
I thought your old injury flared up
or the poisoning set in.

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:07.798
My mind went blank.

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:08.559
I...

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.720
Why would you do that?

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.680
Why did I?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.520
You really don't know?

00:13:23.359 --> 00:13:24.599
Oh, right.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.399
You distracted me so much that

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.200
I almost forgot the important matter.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.079
I found a few folk remedies
for poisoning.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.360
We can try them one by one.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.678
No. I'm not going in.

00:13:44.679 --> 00:13:46.119
No, I won't.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.758
So,

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:15.318
what's the new treatment today?

00:14:15.319 --> 00:14:19.559
This is a medicinal bath
prescribed by a renowned doctor.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.120
It's supposed to cleanse toxins.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.840
The water is just right.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.720
Try it. I'll leave you to it.

00:14:29.719 --> 00:14:31.278
It's a good bath here.

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:33.638
It'd be a shame if I enjoyed it alone.

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:36.359
Stop fooling around.
The water will get cold.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.240
After all this trouble you caused me,

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.799
if you want my cooperation,

00:14:42.319 --> 00:14:43.959
you'll have to pay some interest.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.440
What interest?

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:55.759
Pei Yuze, you...

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.240
Where am I?

00:15:41.359 --> 00:15:42.559
Where is this?

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.599
Somebody!

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.240
Somebody, help!

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.560
Help!

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:05.119
No! It can't be you!
