Have you considered

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.540
I mentioned to you?

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.690
I'm very interested in you,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.090
Mr. Na.

Well... I don't...

Mr. Na.

Mr. Na Aejoon?

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.500
-Mr. Na. Where do you live?
-What?

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.540
Why do you keep calling me mister?

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.870
Huh?

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.520
I mean.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.640
You flirted with me.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.720
Are you being serious?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.720
Seriously?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.570
Yes, well... I'm serious.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.940
Then you shouldn't keep calling me that.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.800
It feels so distant.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.140
You keep calling me Mr. Na.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:25.210
You're like a fantasy,
yet you keep appearing around me.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.040
I can't even tell

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.080
whether this is a dream or reality.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.250
I can't believe you'd come to me.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.080

do you want to be with me today?

Making me so flustered.

Why do you always...

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.030

N-N-Now?

I got a call from him at the door.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.920
And?

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.890
I made him leave by saying
I'd be down in 10 minutes.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.470
Ah...

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.540
You called me just Siyeol yesterday.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.130
What have you done,

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.910
Na Aejoon?

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.000
Was I... that rude?

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.270
I'm sorry.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.460
Why?

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.030
I prefer it when you call me that.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.670
There's still time,
so just eat before going to work.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.790
You know we're shooting today, right?

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.650
See you at school.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.050
Thank you.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.110
I'm leaving.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.660
By the way,

someone saved as "Kyukyu"

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.370
called you.

Oh...

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.380
He kept calling.
He's probably worried.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.110
I was thinking if I should pick it up,
but I didn't.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.660
Who is... he?

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.760
Since you saved his contact
under a nickname,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.330
I guess he's quite close to you.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.420
In this situation,

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.450
if I were to tell him everything...

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.790
He's my roommate.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.860
You know him too. His name is Ji Kyusung.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.820
Ji Kyusung?

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.900
You mean the Chief Manager?

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.890
Yes.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.080
He's my cousin.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.120
I'm actually
living under someone else's roof.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.560
So you've been hiding it from me?

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.520
I didn't hide itâ€“

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.220

there's no way you don't know A-One.

Wait.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.320
You saying you didn't know me at school
was all a lie?

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.320
It wasn't...

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.340
Well...

Wait.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.070
Then you got drunk

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.470
and came into my house
to get close to me?

00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:59.570
It's not like that.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.010
No, it's not like that.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.600
Wh-Where are you touching me?

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.590
You're pissing me off!

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:11.070
This is making me very flustered
and annoyed.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.230
I'm sorry, Siyeol.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.450
Wait, listen to me.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.260
S-Stay away from me.

He keeps asking me for pocket money.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.840
I saw this on Siyeol's live.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.830
I shouldn't touch it.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.290
How can he be so sexy both inside and out?

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.620
And so gentle and kind too?

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.290
I get to look around his house?

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.550

Yes.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.960
He said "see you" to me.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.400
I don't think it's for you but me.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.900
But he's so tall...

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.420
This tall?

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.020
Shush! Come over.

-Yeah.

Yes, it looks nice.

-Can I touch it once? Please.
-Sorry.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.190
I'm sorry.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.690
Just let me have a look.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.990
The older he gets the less popular
he will be anyway. So darn arrogant.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.350
It's for him to hear.

When will Dojoon come out?

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:08.730
Really?

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:09.780

Let's go.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.370
Never mind. We're late.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.290
Do they have any manners?

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.220
Just ignore them.

You'll be tired for
the early morning shoot later.

It's not a joke.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.570
So you can't leave me behind.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.180

I'll let some lines introducing
the school uniforms to the script.

Matching outfit?
