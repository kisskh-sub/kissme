00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:11.479
Du Youmeng.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.838
Oh no, I should call you Lian Xinruo.

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:15.959
Pei Yujie.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.800
You asked me here.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.639
Where are my father's remains?

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:23.479
The dying don't need to know that.

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:24.519
Get her.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.078
Second Master.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.558
I'm worried Xinruo might be in trouble.

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:32.639
Let's hurry.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.520
Stop.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.880
I'll shoot you dead.

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:46.838
Why are you here?

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:48.239
Pei Yujie took Wu Peirong's men

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.919
and headed for
the East Suburb Warehouse.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.719
Xinruo is in danger.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.639
Go save her.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.919
I'll clean up here.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.759
- Wen Yuan, take care of the tungsten.
- Got it.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.119
Trust me.
I'll get the tungsten to a safe place.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.000
Lian Xinruo.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.879
Even after five years,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.039
your skills have become so sharp.

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:19.719
I really underestimated you.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.520
Enough with the nonsense.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.679
Where did you hide my father's remains?

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:27.319
You must already know

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.118
what this is.

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.239
This is what's going to make me rich.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.399
Back then, I kindly invited your father

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.879
to join the Jiang City business.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.160
But he flat-out refused me.

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.879
And once he learned my secret,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.959
I couldn't let him live.

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.039
For your own selfish gain,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.080
you didn't hesitate to take

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.439
another person's life?

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.159
You're truly vicious.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.560
Did you kill Uncle Jiang too?

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:02.719
Him? He was just an accident.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.079
He happened to be where he shouldn't

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.239
and heard what he shouldn't.

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.159
But there was one thing
I didn't lie about.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.000
Lian Chen's body is buried here.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.479
And today, I'll bury you beside him.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.720
What a perfect ending, right?

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.120
You were waiting for her, weren't you?

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.598
Bring her in.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.639
Move.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.839
Miss.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.200
Jin Se.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.959
If not for the alert I got earlier,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.600
I'd never have noticed this shadow.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.518
Now, who wins or loses

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.359
is anyone's guess.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.399
Lian Xinruo, say your prayers.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.518
Miss!

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.559
Wait!

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.800
Xueshan.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.118
Pei Yuze, how dare you.

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:34.799
She's your niece!

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:36.278
Father, save me!

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.439
Pei Yujie.

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:38.879
Let them go.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.959
You think I'd ruin my plans

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.920
for the sake of a girl?

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:45.319
Is that so?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.560
If that's the case,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.759
then I'll just have to be ruthless.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.159
Uncle, please don't kill me.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.159
Father, save me!

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.320
Stop!

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.600
So, you aren't
as heartless as I thought.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.400
Pei Yuze.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.919
You and I are both Pei family.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.399
Why let a woman

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.919
turn us against each other?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.239
Release Xueshan

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.159
and I promise you

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.558
I'll let go of the past

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.758
and hand over the property
that belongs to you.

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:12.839
What do you say?

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.360
Enough with the nonsense.

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:21.079
Let her go.

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:22.679
Yujie, you can't!

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.640
Shut up.

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:28.719
You want me to let them go? Fine.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.879
But you think you can trade one for two?

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.879
Dream on.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.879
Free Jin Se first.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.759
She's injured!

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.919
No, Second Master.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.999
Save her first.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.080
Shut up.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.760
Jin Se.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.400
I'm sorry.

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:44.119
I have to save Youmeng first.

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.519
Pei Yuze!

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.280
It's alright, Second Master.
I understand.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.399
Quiet.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.480
Pei Yujie.

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:03.318
How about I count to three,

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:05.239
and we release them together?

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:06.559
Fine.

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:08.519
One.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.400
Two.

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:15.799
Three.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.838
Pei Yuze, you really are cunning.

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.639
Takes one to know one.

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:28.319
But if you try any more tricks,

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.278
then I'll have no choice

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:33.399
but to cripple Xueshan's arm.

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:34.599
You...

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:36.080
One.

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:37.799
Two.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.439
Three.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.400
Good.

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:47.999
Xueshan, come here!

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.080
Jin Se!

00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:04.919
Pei Yujie!

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:06.399
Put the gun down.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.200
Hand over the antidote.

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:20.159
Antidote? What antidote?

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:23.039
Drop the act.

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:25.278
You know very well how you became

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.879
the family head.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.038
So that's it.

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:32.719
Poisoned, are you?

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.360
Interesting.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.760
Truly interesting.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.160
Pei Yujie.

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:45.919
Who else is involved
in the tungsten deal?

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.839
Stay out of this,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.719
or you won't live to worry about it.

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:51.798
In that case, I'll kill you now

00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:53.359
and avenge my father!

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.598
There's solid proof
of his murders and smuggling.

00:07:56.599 --> 00:07:57.799
Hand him to the police.

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:59.999
No. I've waited long enough.

00:08:02.359 --> 00:08:03.399
Pei Yuze.

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:05.199
Are you going to kill your brother?

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.558
Don't you fear heaven's wrath?

00:08:06.559 --> 00:08:07.199
Miss Du.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.078
Step aside.

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:09.839
Please, don't kill my father.

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:12.839
Shut up, woman! Die!

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.880
Yuze!

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.280
Yuze!

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.880
Father!

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:55.639
Father!

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.880
Father!

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.680
Pei Yuze.

00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:03.798
Hang in there.

00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:05.519
I'll get you to the hospital.

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:08.199
It's alright.

00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:12.639
I've known my time was ending.

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:17.519
I've been ready
to leave this world any moment.

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:19.999
Only...

00:09:21.239 --> 00:09:22.879
After meeting you,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.800
I started to cling to life.

00:09:28.719 --> 00:09:29.919
Xinruo.

00:09:32.719 --> 00:09:34.119
I realize now

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.000
that I've fallen for you.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.200
I love you too.

00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:42.838
Promise me,

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:46.279
for my sake,
you'll fight to live. Please?

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.000
I had planned

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:02.599
to place this on you at our wedding.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.600
But I...

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.200
Xinruo.

00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:16.879
Will you marry me?

00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:20.919
I will.

00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:37.719
Pei Yuze.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.880
Pei Yuze.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.079
Pei Yuze, wake up!

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.760
Pei Yuze!

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:48.399
Pei Yuze!

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.240
You're awake.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.920
I'll get the doctor.

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:45.278
All his vitals are normal.

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:47.319
Luckily, the bullet
missed the vital organs.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.039
A couple days' rest and he can leave.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.400
Thank you, doctor.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.120
See? Now you can relax.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.798
The day they brought you in,

00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:56.718
your wife cried her heart out.

00:11:56.719 --> 00:11:58.399
She nearly
turned the hospital upside down.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.718
She's been caring for you nonstop,

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:01.718
and lost so much weight.

00:12:01.719 --> 00:12:03.798
Once you're better, go home.

00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:04.879
Stop giving us trouble.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.758
Since you're done checking him,

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.199
you should rest now.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.240
I'll get out of your hair now.

00:12:17.159 --> 00:12:18.879
I'll pour some water.

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:24.079
All that you said
that day at the warehouse,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.440
does it still count?

00:12:26.319 --> 00:12:27.519
What did I say?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.520
I don't remember.

00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:31.039
Trying to back out?

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.480
You didn't even put the ring on me,

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.719
and now you're blaming me
for backing out.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.880
Then...

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:43.439
How about the wedding...

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.800
Oh no.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.560
I think I have sand in my eye.

00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:57.319
Where? Let me see it.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.360
Xinruo, can we talk?

00:13:11.319 --> 00:13:12.439
