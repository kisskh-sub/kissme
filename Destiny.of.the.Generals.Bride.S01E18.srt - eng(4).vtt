=Destiny of the General's Bride=

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.020
=Episode 18=

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.960
Grandmother, I heard

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.679
you went
to that tainted place yesterday.

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:18.960
I had them

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.640
prepare a calming tonic for you.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.839
Please try it.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.120
The Xiao family and ours
have always maintained good relations.

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.559
If they truly committed
such a grave crime,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.159
whatever are we to do?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.159
Perhaps it's better if I accuse Qing Yan

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:38.880
of slander and false accusation,

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.960
and give you a Xiao Yun without a wife?

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.240
But what about

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.759
those poor women
who were silenced and blinded?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.320
What?

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.520
Do you believe everything Qing Yan says?

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.200
Grandmother,
I am Princess Zhaoping of Great Yu.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.759
I have been captured
by savages multiple times,

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.799
yet not once have I shed a tear.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.600
I'm confident
I could win Xiao Yun's heart

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.560
without resorting to those means.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:08.959
Besides, those who earn
their living from the people

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.480
must bear their burdens as well.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.480
What if I were not Princess Zhaoping,

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:15.719
but an ordinary woman?

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.599
I fear my name

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.159
would be listed in that ledger too.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.560
So whatever the truth may be,

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.120
you must see
to a thorough investigation.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.760
My Ping has grown sensible.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.079
Rest assured.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.719
Your beloved has already

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.200
reported Xiao Ye's deeds to the court.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.200
He is a man who understands propriety
and the larger picture.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.719
You have not misjudged him.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.959
But, Grandmother, let me be upfront.

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.480
Official matters
must be dealt with fairly.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.480
Matters of love, however,
are a matter of the heart.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.120
I won't let go of the man

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.000
I desire

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.120
without a fight.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.319
As you wish.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.400
Empress Dowager,
Grand Madam Xiao requests an audience.

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:05.560
I won't see her.
Even my Ping knows better

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.319
than that old woman in her 60s.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.599
Of course not.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.840
Does she not know who raised me?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.039
Are you all right?

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.560
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:17.439
I'm fine.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.360
Empress Dowager and Princess Zhaoping
have petitioned His Majesty

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.599
to order a full investigation.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.759
Rest assured.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.560
Justice will be served.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.039
Princess Zhaoping?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.970
Her Highness has reported
everything she's seen and heard

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.599
to His Majesty,

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.759
vouching for you.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.719
No one will be allowed

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.759
to act with impunity simply because

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.120
they claim a sworn father.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.360
I thought
you were more capable than this.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.199
Qing Yan,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.560
you will not defeat me.

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.400
The King of Xiling is my sworn father.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.159
My exile

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.680
was only a formality.

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.319
Get familiar

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.360
with these shackles.

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.719
Soon,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.759
they will be yours.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.080
Whose illegitimate child

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.960
have you brought here to flaunt?

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.639
Second Master,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.360
I'm carrying your child.

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.319
My child?

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.120
How do you prove that?

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.919
Su Man'er, I know the exact kind

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.360
of woman you are.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.360
You dragged your own sister
into your schemes

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.199
just to climb into my bed.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:42.639
How do I know

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
this child isn't

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.199
from some random man,

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.479
born to secure your hold
on the Xiao family's inheritance?

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.159
Second Master,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.280
I have been devoted to you.

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.599
Devoted?

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.560
Wasn't it only to become Second Madam
of the Xiao Residence?

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:04.800
If you had failed,

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.319
would you still be devoted to me?

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.319
Merchants care

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.960
for profit above all else.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.199
What loyalty can a merchant's daughter

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.600
like you really have?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.160
Get away from me.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:28.399
Don't dirty my hands.

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.279
Do you think I deserve this?

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:40.560
Yes.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.720
But what debt existed between us

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:48.560
is now paid in full.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.079
You're not my target.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.199
I have no interest
in watching you fall.

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.319
You're really that kind?

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.319
Far from it.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.480
I remember how,

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.480
when we were young

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:09.480
and discord arose
over our father's affair,

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.199
you said the blame lay with the men,

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:14.959
not the women,
who should not fight amongst themselves.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.279
My sister, Su Man'er,

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:21.199
was never like other women.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.399
But somehow,

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.759
she became the poor woman

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:30.319
betrayed by Xiao Ye.

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.560
I was too naive then.

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:39.120
I didn't realize that women

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:43.120
without a man to lean on

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.279
have no place in this world.

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.319
Did you know

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.319
Yun Juan died?

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.120
She was running a small noodle stall

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:01.720
to make an honest living.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.360
Enough to feed herself and her family.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.199
But Xiao Ye, with a gang of thugs,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.160
exposed her affair

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.160
with him.

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.160
Unable to bear the shame,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.480
she jumped from the city wall

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.160
and died.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.160
It's my fault.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.560
You did wrong by her.

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:30.160
But she was never defeated.

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:32.000
She built a new life

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.560
with her own strength.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.720
Yet, in the end,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.000
she still died under the insult of men.

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:46.240
Don't you see?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.759
Women without men

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.720
can survive.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.199
But women who rely on men

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.160
to save them cannot.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.879
Xiao Yun's mother

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:20.160
was killed by Grand Madam Xiao.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.839
What?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.120
Grand Madam Xiao,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.199
unable to act herself,

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:32.680
relied on her brother and sister-in-law.

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:35.439
When she wanted

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:40.360
to poison Xiao Yun's mother,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.360
she had her brother do it.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.959
Her sister-in-law was present,

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:47.000
and can testify.

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:52.600
Now, Grand Madam Xiao is likely
hiding her sister-in-law

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.120
at the Zhang family ancestral residence.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.519
You'll be able to find her there.

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:00.560
I…

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:01.759
No need to thank me.

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:06.120
With this,

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.560
we are even.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:14.160
Su Hua,

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:18.319
I don't think

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.319
we're destined to be sisters.

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:29.879
But being people
who owe each other nothing,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.720
that's the best ending we can hope for.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.420
(Exile to Qiongzhou)

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.120
Sir, is there any way
to petition His Lordship again?

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:56.720
His Lordship said you failed

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.120
to prevent Xiao Yun

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.559
from presenting
the evidence to His Majesty.

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:02.240
Xiao Ye being exiled to Qiongzhou

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:03.960
is already a lenient sentence.

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:06.320
This case is being personally overseen
by Empress Dowager,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.879
so His Lordship cannot intervene.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.000
However…

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.080
His Lordship said that
once the dust settles,

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:15.120
he will find a chance

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:16.799
to return Xiao Ye to you.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.679
In that case, we are grateful
for His Lordship's compassion.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.399
Ye has always been mindful
of His Lordship.

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:48.360
Second Master Xiao,

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:50.919
have you forgotten us already?

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.799
We could never forget

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.799
everything that happened

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.320
in the Xiao family's wood shed.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.679
At last, some justice has been served.

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:10.960
Whether Xiao Ye

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.080
or the forces behind him,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.759
all must pay the price.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.180
(Letter of Release)

00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:32.960
Princess Zhaoping,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.360
I must respectfully decline.

00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:43.480
Have you considered the consequences
if you refuse?

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:46.679
And if I sign, Your Highness,

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:49.200
have you thought of the consequences?

00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:52.480
Long ago,

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:55.799
Wang Xianzhi tortured
the soles of his feet

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.960
with heated irons to avoid
marrying Princess Xin'an,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.559
leaving him crippled for life.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.399
I'm a general.

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:05.519
I have countless means of interrogation
that leave men crippled for life.

00:11:06.759 --> 00:11:08.559
If you continue to pressure me,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.879
I will not hesitate to do the same

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.559
to myself.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.960
But tell me, Your Highness,

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:18.279
are you prepared
to marry a crippled man?

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:26.279
They say you are a brilliant general

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.720
with grand visions.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.120
A man with great ambition.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.879
But I must ask you this.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.320
Am I so unworthy

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.080
that you would rather
destroy your own body

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:48.759
and forsake your future

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.600
than marry me?

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.879
East of the city gates,

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:55.919
there are ladies in abundance.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.080
Though many,

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.120
none can compare to my beloved.

00:12:01.159 --> 00:12:02.399
Your Highness is perfect in every way,

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:05.519
yet my heart is already elsewhere.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.480
I know

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:17.480
your love is unbreakable

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.200
and unwavering.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.639
But if

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.480
Qing Yan had asked for a divorce,

00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:27.879
would you

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.519
still harm yourself?

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:35.159
Qing Yan wouldn't wish that.

00:12:36.919 --> 00:12:37.960
You're not her.

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:40.480
How can you know what she desires?

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.600
I shall offer her terms

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.960
she cannot refuse.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.420
(Letter of Release)

00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:12.759
Is that all?

00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:16.399
That's all. Two boxes of gold

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:17.679
and

00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:19.960
two men.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.879
They say Great Yu houses
countless handsome men,

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:26.919
and now I've seen for myself.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.279
I've heard tales of great men.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.759
Rong Ziyu in the south

00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:34.679
and Guan Peigong in the north.

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:36.799
How do

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.559
these two compare?

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:44.000
These two men are Ziyu and Peigong.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.960
A woman knows a woman best.

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:54.720
Your Highness, you are generous indeed.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.200
I've been married four times before.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.799
I know well

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:02.919
how easy it is to wed,
but how hard to bond as one.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.039
If I'm

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.519
to sever your bond with your husband,

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.080
I must be willing to offer enough
to guarantee comfort

00:14:09.559 --> 00:14:10.919
for the rest of your life.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.480
Since Your Highness is so understanding,

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:18.000
I will accept without objection.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.240
So you agree

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.279
to the divorce from Xiao Yun?
