=Episode 2=

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.540
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.750
You...

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.280
You're awake.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.030
Where am I?

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.330
How long have I been asleep?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.840
Three years.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.340
Three years?

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.830
Your wounds have healed.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.190
(I can't be reborn again.)

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.980
(The aftereffects are worsening.)

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.970
(My slumber grows longer each time.)

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.310
(Next time, I might never wake again.)

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.640
Where is Liu He?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.080
How is he?

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.350
Is he doing well?

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.460
Where is he now?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.560
Lord Xu has taken him back to Changyi.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.990
All is going smoothly now.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.360
In the end,
he still returned to Changyi.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.030
Nothing has changed.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.230
His Majesty has arrived.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.320
The Emperor...

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.470
Careful.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.930
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.740
Heng.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.190
This is my new friend.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.090
Kang Ning.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.310
Heng, Qi.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.320
See you again.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.160
(Bingyi, Kang Ning...)

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.300
(Liu Xun, Emperor Xuan of Han)
(Kang Ning is Liu Xun.)

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.910
(So, Empress Xu Pingjun)

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.400
(has likely been killed by Huo Xian.)

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.280
Heng.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.870
You're finally awake. Please rise.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.450
Come on.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.490
Thanks, Your Majesty.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.930
Heng has just woken up.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.280
Lady De Jiu, please prepare some food.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.390
Yes.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.250
I still prefer you call me Kang Ning.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.750
Things have changed.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.720
Please accept my condolences.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.670
The past always lingers.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.110
The Empress
and you shared deep feelings.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.100
Now that the Empress has
passed away,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.730
may you find solace.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.040
Pingjun wished for you to wake up.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.130
She said you possessed
the talent of statecraft,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.430
fit for great duty.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.560
What a pity

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.000
that she never lived to see this.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.590
Heng.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.040
You've slept for three years,

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.760
yet you know everything.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.560
You truly seem to know
the Mandate of Heaven.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.990
I ask for your aid, Heng.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.750
Back in Wucheng Village,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.680
you saved my life.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.260
I will give my all in return.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.240
I've figured out
that Huo Guang's kin killed Pingjun.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.600
But now in the Imperial Court,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.510
I stand alone with no ally.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.660
My strength falls short.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.610
What path should I take next?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.790
Heng, I need you to guide me.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.870
Does the Mandate of Heaven
hold a way out?

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.440
I will aid you.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.220
But may I also ask a favor in return?

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.350
What is it?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.960
Please treat Liu He with kindness.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.360
Is it also the Mandate of Heaven?

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.590
No.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.560
It is loyalty and honor.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.030
Very well.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.990
I trust you, and I promise you that.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.000
For the coming years,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.270
you need only remember one word:

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.340
Endure.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.270
Besides that,

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.330
show great favor to the Huo Clan.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.510
Three years from now,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.290
Huo Guang will die of illness.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.960
He shall have a grand burial.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.760
Grant the Huo Clan endless honors,

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.870
and they will lower their guard,

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.930
growing ever more reckless.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.120
Their ambition will rise,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.270
and flaws and weaknesses will follow.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.080
In this way,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.270
you will have the cause to uproot them.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.230
To me alone,

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.000
the Huo Clan and I are mortal enemies.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.160
To the realm,

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.530
the Huo Clan's merit is beyond measure.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.070
They are loyal subjects of the Han.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.350
You know the answer.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.370
You just want to be sure.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.690
If things go as you say,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.680
I'll let Great General Huo

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.970
live his remaining years in peace

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.250
and be remembered for generations.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.520
Heng,

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.050
the command token under your pillow

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.600
was passed to you by Pingjun
on my behalf.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.190
From that very moment,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.610
you became my confidant.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.040
I have endured for 21 years.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.680
What is three more years to me?

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.160
However,

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.800
I must plan ahead for those three years.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.730
Wang Heng, Imperial Guard Commander,
hear my command.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.180
If the Huo Clan harbors
treacherous intent in the future,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.400
you are to investigate in secret

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.330
and proceed with utmost caution

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.480
to confirm
whether their disloyalty is real

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.010
and be certain beyond doubt.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.260
There must be no negligence.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.710
Your Majesty,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.040
with my health in such a state,

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.030
how can I still serve you?

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.670
Your Majesty.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.710
Then I must trouble

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.970
the Colonel of the Huben Army

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.100
to help Heng regain his strength.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:40.710
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.270
I will not fail your trust.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:44.270
Colonel?

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.480
Your

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.750
right-hand.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:54.750
Careful.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.440
Careful.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.640
Ready?

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.230
Let go.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.370
One...

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.240
One step.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.330
Step.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.390
- Two steps.
- Two steps.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.280
One

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:24.920
step.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.440
Two

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.840
steps.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.510
Three...

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.060
Rest every three steps.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.390
Three.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.840
Go slower up the stairs.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.470
No rush.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.710
What does this gesture mean?

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.600
That's called OK.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.050
It means all right.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.100
It means completed.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.920
♪Night flows♪

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.530
♪Over the window frames and treetops♪

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.240
To Liu He.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.870
How have you been?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.600
- Now,
- Too slow.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.450
- it's the Benshi Year 3.
- Faster.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.930
I'm recovering.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.090
De Jiu is looking after me.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.480
Ouch.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.440
It hurts.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:32.290
Hold on.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.740
I'm fine.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.000
Did you receive

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.210
the last letter I sent you?

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.510
Looking forward

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.760
to your reply.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.220
Thrust.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.460
Turn.

A few days ago,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.920
Huo Guang's son, Huo Yu,
staged a rebellion.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.780

pulled off lots of missions.

in the Huben Army.

De Jiu's a Colonel.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.690
The traitor Huo Yu gathered a faction

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:33.800
to plot treason.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:34.790

- Stop!

Also,

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.870
I thought the fall of the Huo Clan

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.690
- could lead me to the Qilin.
- Stop them.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:45.400
Don't move.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.680
But there was a slight setback.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.500
The Huo Clan committed treason.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.770
They shall be crushed today.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.140

His Majesty is merciful.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.340
He knows you were coerced
by the Huo Clan.

Alright.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.470

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.180
I'll talk.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.660
A mysterious force entered the mansion,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.440
led by a woman from the Western Regions.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.500
I heard the patriarch
struck a deal with her.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.590
She claimed she'd use witchcraft
to clear obstacles.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.300
She left with a pair of Bronze Qilin.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.520

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.220

was swift and clean.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.910
I am greatly pleased.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.100
I know

you have your own motives.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.070
That's why you risked so much.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:02.960

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.630

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.590

What does that mean?

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.600
Lying back means

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.200
not striving for more

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.130

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.240
Well, that's one way to live.

You can afford to lie back,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.370
