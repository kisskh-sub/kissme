Shut up!

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.320
You've got a crush?!

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.520
Shush!

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.400
Keep it down!

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.800
Who is it?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.760
Can you tell me?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.120
Think of it as a trade.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.040
Swear you won't tell anyone this!

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.120
Alright.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.280
The person I have a crush on is...

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.440
Print.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.520
For real?!

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.280
Have you told her how you feel?

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.000
If I had, I wouldn't be able
to look her in the face.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.760
You really like to overthink, huh?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.640
Maybe...

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.360
she's waiting for you to confess.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.160
What if she isn't?

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.360
I'm not gonna risk it.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.080
Guys, get a big round of applause

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.920
for The Doll Mansion,
whose rating's been through the roof.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.360
Print is now the woman of the hour

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.400
with fans massively
keeping an eye on her love life!

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.200
Don't forget to follow us

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.720
Thank you, guys, for giving love
to The Doll Mansion.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.240
If you think
the first two episodes are spicy,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.400
wait until you see the rest!

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.960
Don't forget to stay tuned!

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.400
I guarantee you the fun's waiting.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.880
"Your dress is pretty..."

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.880
[She's already sexy in that dress;
imagine her without one]

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.320
[I wanna see you changing clothes]

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.240
I gotta go now.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.080
Please give me a follow

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.160
on my real channel
"Print's Payday."

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.000
Thank you for today!

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.560
You blocked them?

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.840
But those are your fans.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.040
With those kinds of comments,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.080
it's gotta be done.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.400
Why would I put up with it?

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.000
I thought you didn't normally care.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.440
Well...

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.960
it wasn't as bad before,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.440
but that was full-on harassment.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.200
What's wrong with
protecting myself from creeps?

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.560
My,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.040
for a second there,
I thought you were jealous.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.120
Who's jealous?

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.040
Don't be such a narcissist!

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680
Hello!

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.400
Alright, let's go.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.600
Get ready to stand by.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.880
Please!

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.960
Uh...

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.560
Fon!

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.600
I don't know if my zipper
went up all the way.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.880
Can you help?

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.560
- Hurry up.
- I'll go first, okay?

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.440
Go.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.320
Move.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.360
Scoot your butt over there.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.680
Rey, you can lead the way.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.440
I'll follow you.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.680
It's fine. Go on.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.880
Girl, stay still!

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.320
I'll make you admit that you like me.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.680
Just you wait.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.080
What's up with you?

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.240
I'm uncomfortable!

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.280
Why?

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.320
Did you gain weight?

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.920
Is it the dress?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.440
It's not!

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.280
It's the comments
from the livestream earlier!

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.520
"She's already sexy in that dress.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.440
Imagine her without one."

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.840
"I want to see Print
changing clothes."

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.360
Ew, that gives me the ick!

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.320
Yuck, you're right.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.440
But...

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.360
You've always got
those kinds of comments.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.400
Why are you affected by them
all of a sudden?

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.080
They just pissed me off!

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.160
Alright, calm down.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.560
If you were that pissed,
didn't you already go off on them?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.680
I didn't.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.840
But I did block them.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.400
You need to threaten them
with a lawsuit.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.200
Those creeps need to be
taught a lesson!

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.960
Uh-huh...

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.240
Starting from the person I blocked.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.520
Right.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.400
Can I get your autograph?!

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.600
Can you sign this for me?

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.000
Hi, Print!

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.080
Please excuse us.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.840
Excuse me.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.480
Let's go, Print.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.800
How did...

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.680
they follow us home?

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.080
This was the first time
someone followed you home.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.720
Worst of all,

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.720
they now know you live together.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.680
I don't think Print's house
is safe anymore.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.440
How about this?

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.160
Let the girls stay in a hotel
for the time being.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.920
Hotel reservations
are not hard to track for these people.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.040
How about...

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.840
we let Rey move into my condo?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.320
I'll take care of her.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.360
I agree with that,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.280
but how could you be sure that creep
hasn't been following you, too,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.000
since everyone knows
you're Print's manager?

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.920
If we have her move to my condo,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.240
but I have to live somewhere else,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.560
where exactly
do you expect me to sleep, Miss?

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.840
You can come to my office.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I don't mind.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.760
Or you can...

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.720
stay over at a hotel.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.520
Whatever floats your boat.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.640
So that means

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.880
I have to live in Fon's condo...

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.560
alone?

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.160
Thank you for keeping me company.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.880
What choice do I have?

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.160
We're in each other's bodies anyway.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.160
If we go our separate ways,

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.240
we're gonna be cooked.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.320
Damn it!

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.880
Since Mai and Fon
have put you in my care...

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.520
just consider me

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.280
your acting manager.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.120
My manager...

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.160
Yes, Miss Manager.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.080
Since I have something to post today,

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.320
could you be my camerawoman?

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.520
Please?

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.240
Pretty please?

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.240
Mm...

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.520
Turn that way.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.160
Just go change your top!

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.520
It's too revealing.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.000
This is all I have with me.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.800
Everything was so sudden

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.720
that I didn't have time to pack.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.400
You can...
find something from Fon's wardrobe.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.680
I...

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.920
I don't like seeing myself
with that much skin.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.320
No matter what I wear, it wouldn't
satisfy the body's owner.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.160
Why don't you just...

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.920
pick the outfit for me?

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.760
This?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.800
Not it!

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.840
No.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:30.920
That's a no!

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.280
Hey,

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.240
we've almost gone through her closet
at this point.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.040
Just pick the one you want me to wear.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.280
That one.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.960
- Which one?
- That one.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.600
- This?
- Mm.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.280
Go change.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.240
I'll...wait outside.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.280
Hold on.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.600
Pick a pair of pants for me.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800
Whoa,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.440
you haven't changed a bit.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.520
Always a perfectionist.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.040
Right,

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.280
I sent my clothes away for dry-cleaning

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.680
- Mm.
- and forgot to grab something with me.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.120
Can I maybe borrow your PJs?

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.640
Of course, just...

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.640
look in the closet.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.800
- This closet?
- Mm.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.840
Excuse me, then.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.080
I'll go with this one

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.000
since it seems the most comfy.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.360
Someone...happened to leave it here.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.760
But you can wear it if you want.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.920
I don't think she'll ever
come back for it.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.320
Forget it.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.240
I don't want to wear
random people's clothes.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.000
You really haven't changed a bit.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.800
These unmatched pajamas

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.840
are from completely different people,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.680
aren't they?

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.840
No need to answer, actually.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.520
I was just asking.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.800
So this is what's been going on...

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.800
Ah-hah...

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.160
I guess this one is finally yours,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.320
so I'll just take it

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.880
since I'd hate to sleep
in just some girls' clothes.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.280
Mm.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.800
- Mai.
- Hm?

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.960
Your shirt looks pretty good on me,

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.960
don't you think?

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.240
Anything else you want?

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.120
Actually, a scrunchy would be nice,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.120
or just anything
I can use to put my hair up.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.480
I lost mine.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.840
Try looking in that box over there.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.000
This one?

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.360
Mm.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.840
Mai.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.000
Hm?

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.200
Whose is this?

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.240
Your lovers are pretty forgetful
with their stuff, aren't they?

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.240
You still have this?

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.640
I thought you threw it away.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.920
Your crush...
share the same birthday as mine,

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.360
don't they?

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.880
Are you alright?

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.120
I...

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.880
I think you're way too drunk.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.080
Just go home.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.320
I used to think that

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.760
if I hadn't kissed you that day...

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.200
what would have happened between us?

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.480
How would you like it to happen?

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.120
Just anything...

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.960
other than me getting fired.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.600
But when I really think about it,

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.400
I'm glad that I did it.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.120
Otherwise, I wouldn't have seen
your true color,

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.360
and I would've chased after you
until my death.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:27.960
Hello?

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.120
Have you gone to bed?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Almost.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.040
Don't tell me you're so scared
that you can't sleep?

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.080
Who is?

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.120
I'm not scared.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.920
I'm already in bed,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.320
and my eyes are getting heavy.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.000
You don't have to be scared.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.840
If that creep followed us
all the way here,

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.080
he'd have to go through me first.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.400
Are you...

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.600
really not gonna sleep by my side?

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.680
Right, the couch
could give you breakouts.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.200
Fon's room is much cleaner
than my house.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.960
Plus...

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.880
you're a snorer.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.640
What if I don't get enough sleep?

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:08.880
Mm...

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.840
Whatever makes you happy.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.840
Print?

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.280
Why are you so quiet?

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.840
Shh, hang on a sec.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.200
I'm reading my fortune.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.240
Ugh, so that's why!

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.280
It says I'm facing
some serious misfortunes,

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.560
but I don't have to be worried.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.720
After my birthday,

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.640
all will be well,

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.240
both for my career and my love life.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.440
And when's your birthday?

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.640
The 20th of this month.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.520
So, it means that in 2 weeks...

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.120
every hardship will pass.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.600
Wait...

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.440
About the birthday
you read the fortune for,

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.680
should it be yours,
since you're the body owner,

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.320
or mine, since I'm in your body?

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.000
This year's gonna be special.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.680
Let's share our birthdays.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
May wonderful blessings
come to both of our ways.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.680
Rey...

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.280
do you want to...

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.120
exchange gifts on our birthdays?

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.520
Or maybe we can ask each other
to fulfill a birthday wish

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.880
without saying no.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.480
Mm...

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.720
Then,

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.840
could I...

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.160
ask for my birthday gift in advance?

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.440
Shoot it.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.200
I'm scared...

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.080
Could you come sleep with me?

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.240
Thank you, Print.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.520
Just tell me what you wish
for your birthday.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.680
Shit! There's a fire!

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.800
Wake up!

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.360
Rey!

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.840
Rey, are you okay?!

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.160
You're awake?

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.200
I was just done making breakfast.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.640
What do you think?

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.000
Does it look yummy?

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.840
Well, if you told me

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.280
this was made by Miss Rey,

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.440
I'd give an A for effort...
I guess?

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.400
There's no need for the sarcasm.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.640
This is my first time doing this.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.720
I think it's quite lovely.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.920
It is, but...

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.640
If you don't know how to cook,

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.120
why didn't you wake me up?

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.600
Go sit and wait.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.640
I'll take care of the rest.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.960
I couldn't make sense
of what Fon has in her fridge.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.880
I'm making this
from whatever you saw in there.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.920
Fon's soy sauce ran out,

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.600
so this might be a little bland.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.040
Give it a taste,

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.440
and if you don't like it,

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.080
you can order takeout.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.440
I'll go pick it up for you.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.480
Okay.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.960
Here, take a bite.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.320
Try it.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.400
It's not bland,

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.440
quite well-balanced, actually.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.400
Delicious.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Rey,

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.160
be careful.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.720
The soup's still hot.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.280
You can slow down;

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.400
I won't fight you for it.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.600
I'll...pour you some water.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.040
Speaking of which...

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.080
You and I

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.440
kinda look like newlyweds.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.520
Just kidding!

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
What is that photo?

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.800
Wait.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.440
You still keep the photo from that day?

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.560
I didn't mean to keep it...

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.440
I just...forgot to throw it away.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.800
- I see...
- Since I realize it now,

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.160
I'll throw it away.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.760
Throw it in the bin, then.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.480
Why put it in your pocket?

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.840
Right! I'd better ask Fon
to buy some soy sauce!

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.200
Is there something else you want?

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.560
No.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.760
Didn't you mention
you didn't bring enough clothes?

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.240
I'll tell Fon that,

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.880
so she can bring tons,

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.080
or all, of them to you.
Okay?

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:29.960
Okay!

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.080
Fon...

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.000
Is this too intentional?

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.600
I accidentally ordered extra food.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.000
If you're hungry,
you can have it.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.360
I didn't hear you.
What did you say?

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.560
- I ordered...
- Oh, you want soy sauce

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.560
and some clothes?

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.320
Alright, I'll go get them for you.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.040
Maybe around 2 P.M.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.000
They are definitely arguing.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.080
Where are you going?

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.640
Grabbing some stuff for Print.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.040
She wants some clothes.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.080
I'll be back. See you.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.920
I'm coming with you.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.360
Why?

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.440
I'll be back before you even know it.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.960
I want to see Rey.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.080
Chop-chop.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.600
Continue with the phone call.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.680
- I'll throw it away for you.
- Nah!

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.520
Aren't you gonna throw it away?

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.560
- You said you were.
- Eat your breakfast.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.880
Aren't you hungry?

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.560
- I'll...
- Talk to her; I'll take care of that.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.760
I'll take care of it myself.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.720
Wait...

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.880
Is something wrong?

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.560
[Where are ya?
Couldn't find you anywhere]

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:39.280
[Keep hiding since you're so good at it]

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.480
Does that mean...

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.440
they got into your house?

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.720
Fon!

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.240
What did she want?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Some clothes...

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.440
Hey,

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.720
what are you doing?!

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.840
- Tell me.
- Uh... Well...

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.920
Have you seen my cat?

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.360
I'm looking for it.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.600
Let go of her!

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.560
Let her go!

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.640
Fon!

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.400
Are you okay?

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.320
Are you hurt?

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.760
They still haven't gotten the culprit,

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.560
but I already gave the police
my statement about his "P" tattoo

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.000
as you told me.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.520
If we can't catch the bad guy,

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.720
will Print and I have to keep on hiding?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.440
I won't let the guy roam around.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.400
I'll do whatever it takes to catch him.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.640
I think...

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.520
he sneaked in among the fans

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.360
since Print has a lot of fanboys.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.640
Then...

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.400
we have to lure him out.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.280
How are we gonna do that?

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.080
A fan meeting!

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.440
If...

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.760
If we hold a fan meeting
with a chance to meet Print up close,

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.240
he's definitely gonna show up!

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.560
But isn't a fan meeting
way too big of an event?

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.760
Will we ever find the bad guy?

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.480
You're right...

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.360
What if we don't make it a huge event,

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.400
but maybe a birthday gathering for her?

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.760
How about something like this?

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.520
A bit higher.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.800
We're gonna limit the maximum capacity
to 30 people

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.160
chosen from the winners
who answer Print's super fan quiz

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.760
the fastest and most accurately.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.480
I found the venue

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.920
that has enough capacity
and still in the budget.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.000
Good.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.760
Now, let's assign the work.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.360
Just tell me how I can help.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.640
You?

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.240
Just sit still in this room.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.480
Wait, what?

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.400
But I can really help!

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.520
I know.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.480
But I don't want you
to be more of a target at the event.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.520
Almost time to begin.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.160
Please be on standby, Miss Print.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.280
Print!

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.600
I told you

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.560
I'd never leave you alone.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.520
What is that outfit?

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.720
Well, it's a disguise.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.520
You look like you could use this.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.400
Uh-uh.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.320
Just try it!

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.800
Try it on.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.240
There.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.000
It's now time to start.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.520
Let's welcome...Print!

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.880
Thank you, everyone, for coming!

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.360
I'm so grateful for today's fan meeting.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.480
Thank you so much!

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.920
I'll start with
my very iconic dance moves.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.680
Print's Payday,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.400
Pay Up Babies,

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.920
The Basket Awaits.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.680
It's 23.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.440
Alright, guys!
Please give her a round of applause!

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.440
Next up is the announcement
of the lucky fans

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.400
who'll be receiving the benefit
of a one-on-one photo with Print...

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.120
And! And...

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.240
getting to talk to her
in a private room!

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.200
Alright,

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.600
please allow us
to draw the lucky fan's number.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.240
Right, we got it!

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.240
And our lucky fan is...

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.440
Number 23!

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.800
Where are you, Number 23?!

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.560
Please show yourself!

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.920
Please step forward!

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.360
Oh...

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.960
Alright, let's hear it for him!

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.880
Could you please take No. 23
to the private room?

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.280
Please investigate the suspect for us,
Officer Jin.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.320
Of course.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.680
If there's nothing further,
I'll take the girls home.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.920
I think you should stay

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.120
since you're our best bet
to identify the culprit.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.280
Fon, you can stay.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.120
Could you give us a ride home?

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.520
Then, can I please
leave them to you, Officer Jin?

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.160
My pleasure.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.160
Go.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.400
Well, where's Print?

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.760
We ask for permission
to examine.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.160
Hey, what are you doing?!

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.840
Is that it, Fon?

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.200
It's not...

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.200
The tattoo I saw
was just a letter P.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.960
Do you have problems
with the tattoo of my own name?

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.600
If it's not him, then who?!

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.120
We've searched through
everyone in the event.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.600
And what if that guy
didn't come as a fan?

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.720
Apart from the fans,

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.720
there are only us and the officers.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.400
Mai, I think we have the wrong guy!

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.280
Thank you very much, Officer,
for taking care of us today

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.840
and even seeing us home.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.680
It's all good.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.080
It's my job, anyway.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.200
Thank you.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.640
But if you really wanna thank me,

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.040
can you excuse us two
for a private moment?

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.520
Just Print and me.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.680
I've been looking all day
for my time alone with Print,

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.240
and you are the only one

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.480
taking that perfect moment
away from me.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.080
It was our plan
to catch the stalker through this event.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.480
He knew every single one
of our movements

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.320
because he's one of the officers
who supervised today's event.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.280
Have you come to realize his motive?

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.600
Excuse me...

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Our main focus now
should be on the victims' mental state.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.720
I guess we're done now.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:05.760
Let's go.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.400
How are the victims feeling now?

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.240
Are they okay?

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.040
Ow!

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.000
Stay still.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.920
Why did you go all that way?

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.600
You're lucky to end up
with a scratch on the elbow.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.040
What if you were stabbed by that knife?

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.800
My bad.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.400
I just couldn't help but act cool.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.040
I ended up...

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.320
injuring your body.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.280
Don't you ever think
that I'm genuinely worried about you?

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.280
I heard

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.120
everything you told Auer.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.760
What thing?

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.400
Don't tell me

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.920
it was about me

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.760
stealing the packed meals home?

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.520
It was about you telling Auer

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.520
who you were into.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.360
Um...

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:19.800
I told him that the person I like...

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.680
is...

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.080
you.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.200
Rey,

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.320
do you remember the birthday wish
we talked about?

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.360
Mm.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.240
You've asked one for yours that day...

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.280
since it's my birthday today,

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.360
can I tell you what I wish for?

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.480
Mm, sure.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.480
What do you wish for?

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.160
I'm only asking for one thing.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.320
You don't have to feel
the same way about me,

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.520
but...

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.120
can you not distance yourself from me?

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:39.880
Rey,

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.520
can we...

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.000
still be friends?

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.080
What if...

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.600
I don't wanna be friends?

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.440
You mean...

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.200
I didn't really feel that...

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.360
Can we do it again?
