- I need to talk to her for a moment.
- Take your time.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.570
How could you kill your wife? Face reading is science.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.900
Thank you for cooperating in our investigation.

I believed him because he said he would divorce her, but it has come to this.

Don't get into a fight trying to come in.

If my mom calls you, tell her I'm okay.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.820
What are you talking about? Where are you trapped?

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.760
I'll protect the apartment.

Wait, Bom, tell me exactly what's going on. What's...

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.460
I mean, I was going to tell you when I knew for sure...

Enjoy and order more.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.680
Are you a cop, too, Ahjussi?

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.120
How did you know that? Oh, you saw this.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.590
I'm not anyone suspicious. I'm a friend of that ahjussi across the hallway.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.710
I see. You have two jobs, but why do you have a gun with you?

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.040
Well, there's a bad guy who lives in this building so I came to get him.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.070
Those people only think you're a cop if they see a gun.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.730
- Can I see it up close?
- No, no, no. It's dangerous.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.370
Actually, I have never used it in real-life.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.760
I just carry it around.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.380

Are you dead? I'm back, and you won't even look.

Geez, you're exaggerating about the pain.

- "Lady, come out! Your apartment building is on fire!"

She can't do intense exercises, and she can't ever bleed.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.340
- What?
- I'm busy right now. I will call you later.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.400
[Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae Seok]

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.000
Colonel? Can we meet?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.420
What do you mean when? As soon as possible.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:43.490
You know Park Min Ji was taking a drug, right? Did you take it, too?

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.540
Did Min Ji turn like that because of that drug?

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.760
You can't run away now anyway so stay still in here.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.980
Well, you can consult a lawyer if you want.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.650
Me, too? But I don't even live here.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.740
No one can leave, and no one can come in.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.250
You're a cop. Can't you do something?

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.600
I can't leave, either.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.470
I heard there's a residents meeting soon. Let's go down together.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:25.020
I don't want to. I'm sure the rumor spread about what happened in this apartment. What would people think of me?

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.770
Then are you going to stay in here with Oh Joo Hyung?

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.570
Just a moment.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.130
What now? What, what, what?

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.720
I'm worried about Woo Sang Hee.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.610
I will release you later. Take a nap.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:12.220
What the hell are you doing right now? Why are you doing this to me?

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:18.520
How about going to the bathroom? The bathroom... Should I just release it in the room?

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.520
Don't spill.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:40.820
Are you really not going?

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:45.290
I really want to go, but you know how sensitive I am.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.760
If I go to a crowded place while Madman Rabies is going around...

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.260
I can't be myself 100 percent.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.140
What about me? Don't you think I'm afraid?

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.860
That's why I live trusting only you.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.660
The clients will be lining up on a day like today.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.720
This lockdown has a high potential of having legal issues.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.480
I understand. I'll go and promote our business.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.780
So Yoon, fighting.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.430
Hello.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:29.630
I heard you arrested the ahjussi across the hallway. Where is he now?

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.000
He's at home,

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:39.300
due to the lockdown. I handcuffed him so you can tell your husband to go see him for a consultation.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.020
Is there proof of the murder?

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.530
You should ask him directly about that too.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:51.690
But if I were you two, I wouldn't take his case.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.380
Sang Hee! Sang Hee, you're out there, right? Sang Hee, please

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.270
talk to me, all right? We live and die together. Hey!

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.410
No.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.930
Hey, do you think you can live a good life by yourself?

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.600
Everyone will know you as a cheater, and you can't even get out of here because of the lockdown.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.730
You have no money, and you'll probably get fired from the hospital. The only one who could understand you

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.470
is me, Sang Hee.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:27.060
You know me, you know?

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.390
Sang Hee, I'll give you money. Okay?

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.830
Sang Hee!

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.780
How much money would you give me?

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:57.130
Hello. I'm the wife of attorney Gook Hae Sung in unit 602.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:01.670
Please call this number here if you have any legal problems.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.560
They don't know anything about a drug.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.940
They got all angry, saying that they don't take steroids.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.750
Are there only residents from our building here?

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:28.490
Yes, just our building. I think we're all meeting separately.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.880
Dear residents of Seyang Forest Le Ciel.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.190
Due to risks of additional infections inside the apartment complex,

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.820
the entire apartment complex will be in cohort quarantine for a week.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.370
Wait, wait! Wait, Ma'am! I don't even live here. Do I have to be locked up in here?

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:58.250
Until the management of infected and total inspection is possible,

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:02.500
- we will compensate for the damages caused by the lockdown.
- Never mind the compensation.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.320
We will make sure there are no inconveniences, including meals and other needs.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.260
Please hang in there with us. If you need anything in addition,

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.110
please discuss among yourselves and let me know. That will be all.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.970
- Wait, that can't be!
- Wait, no! Wait!

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.890
Geez, Ahjussi!

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:25.500
I'm sure you're all in shock, but if you're a Seyang Forest Le Ciel resident,

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.680
I believe you will calmly overcome this crisis.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.670
What do you mean, calm?

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:34.160
Now, now. I can't hear you if everyone speaks at once.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.380
I will give you a chance to speak in order.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:42.350
Is this because there was an infected person here yesterday? My goodness!

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:48.120
We have to prevent this based on coming in contact. I never even saw that person!

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:54.210
Well, the lady from unit 302 bumped into the woman from unit 601 yesterday and fell.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.260
- Did you not hear that?
- Really?

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.300
I guess you lack communication among family members.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.730
But if the disease is infectious, we shouldn't gather around like this, right?

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:10.770
- You saw the news, right? It is not spread through the air so don't worry.
- How can we believe that?

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:16.990
But what if there's an infected person with us who suddenly attacks trying to bite us?

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:23.720
- Since we are all together in this small space, we would all bite, kill and taste each other...
- Gosh, my head hurts.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:29.340
To be honest, I don't think there are any more infected people among the residents in our building.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.950
Everyone here is so sophisticated.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.810
Fortunately, we have cops here as well.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:37.630
Sirs?

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.420
Don't look at me. I will suffocate. You go out.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.130
Some characteristic behaviors are displayed right before the disease surfaces.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:56.720
You feel extreme thirst and your pupils shrink, making your eyes look white.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.450
When one is alone in an empty space, they knock on walls or display some obsessive behaviors.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.670
If possible, get together with more than two people

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.790
and leave a door open while you're together.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:11.070
If you notice that you are behaving suspiciously, ask for help from those around you right away.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.540
But I live alone! How could I be with two or more?

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.460
It's for a week.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:21.520
We only have to hang on for a week.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.230
[Exit]

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:52.930
You wanted to lock this place down while the children were at school. I noticed you stopped the cars from coming home.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.900
You wanted a lockdown without children, right?

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.820
That would look better.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.500
There is a child who didn't go to school. Let her leave.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.610
You could do that much, can't you?

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.690
Park Seo Yoon, we are testing her parents.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.280
Both of them are highly likely to be infected.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:18.330
- Are you sure?
- Delivery work is tough. They probably took it as a stimulant.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:23.490
I'm sure they're calling the child and saying, "I love you, I miss you."

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:29.210
That's all useless. No one knows how drastically people could change when push comes to shove.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:36.130
Colonel, talk about your pessimistic view of family with your blind date.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.080
What do you want me to do?

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.320
I'm saying it's better for Seo Yoon to stay in here with a good guardian.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.330
On the outside...

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.250
you just don't know how things could change.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.820
Ahjussi Cop,

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:03.310
the wall outside... It looks like I could climb over it if I tried.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:07.260
Would I get punished if I climbed over it?

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.880
More than that, I'm sure the reporters outside would be delighted.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.330
You might even make it to the evening news.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:20.510
How about food? Are we eating on our own?

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:25.990
We'll pass out lunch boxes starting tomorrow morning. You have something to eat tonight, right?

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.680
But where are the apartment management people?

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:33.060
The apartment building was put in lockdown at 9:30 a.m., but no one had come into work by then.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:37.360
The night shift staff went to a meeting in another building. This doesn't make any sense at all.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:43.120
What, what, what? So other buildings are meeting without us?

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.990
They're scared because the first infected person was our building.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.130
They have abandoned their duty.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.110
Then no one from the management office is in this building?

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:02.900
Yes, no one is here. Something we shouldn't keep quiet about has happened.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.060
There's someone outside.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:14.500
I lived in the States with my husband, but we returned to Korea because we fell in love with Korea's disease prevention.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:19.900
Excuse me, Building Representative. The management office staff is standing outside.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.620
It's not just this incident. There is a lot of corruption in this apartment building.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:30.450
Do you know that they fixed the elevator in secret because it failed the installation inspection?

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:36.820
They collect recyclables only once a week, and they're spending money to maintain roadside trees inside the complex. Did you know that?

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:42.090
If you trust and follow me, I will represent all the residents

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:47.390
and resolve all the irregularities within this apartment complex.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:51.020
Please allow the renters to use the gym as well.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:57.120
My husband went to a seminar in Kentucky in the US.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:02.600
I'm sure some of you are wondering about the church service due to the lockdown.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:09.530
Hallelujah. God is always by your side.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:14.480
All the believers can come to me.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:22.180
If anyone needs a damage compensation estimate due to the lockdown or needs any legal advice, please talk to me.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.330
We'll serve you with quality legal representation.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.730
Please come to unit 602.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:31.200
- Let's go.
- Hurry up and come.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.460
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:43.600
I heard you're some kind of police, too.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.960
You should cooperate with keeping the order inside the apartment building.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.730
I work in a different field. I only learned to suppress terrorists.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.690
Please talk to me if you need any cooperation.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.890
Am I getting paid more? I don't think so.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:11.290
However, I'm sure it will help me with my promotion.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:15.360
Gosh, I had no idea when I came in here. I want to go home and make deliveries, too.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.950
What is this about?

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.390
You have to tell me so I can talk, too.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:29.000
- Why lock the door...
- Let me ask you one thing. Are you close with this person?
[Kim Joo Heon]

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.720
Joo Heon? No, we work alternate days so I haven't even seen him that often.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.190
And he stopped coming into work a few days ago so I came in every day.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.210
You drink so much water. Do you keep getting thirsty?

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.160
I've always drunk a lot of water.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.500
Can you open this? Oh, I'm from the Special Operations Unit.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.030
Sure. Okay.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.310
Go ahead and look.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:11.040
One of your colleagues sold some drugs here.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:16.010
The authorities believe that the drug is causing that Madman Rabies.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.410
You're aware of the symptoms, right?

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:22.340
Extreme thirst. Hallucinations.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.870
Be straight with us. Did you take the drug?

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:34.570
No. I didn't take anything besides supplements.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.900
You know who took them, right?

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:41.130
If you don't tell us now, you could be charged with selling drugs.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:44.350
Gosh, I really don't know.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.700
Hiding the truth isn't going to get you anywhere.

Hey, where are you going?

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.350
They're not answering the phone. What should I do?

00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:52.380
Hey, where are you going?

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:01.830
He must be hiding in here somewhere.

[Seyang Forest Le Ciel]

00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:14.770
It's a wrong card.

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:30.930
Let's go.

00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:43.200
Is he not there?

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.020
He's not.

00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:50.090
What's that?

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:56.610
Hey!

00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:02.210
It's blood.

00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:14.350
Let's go.

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:16.520
- Let's see what's going on.
- Sae Bom!

00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:19.850
I don't like being scared, not knowing what happened.

00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:58.770
Ahjussi! Come out!

00:58:58.770 --> 00:58:59.940
Shouldn't we take him with us?

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:02.600
Hurry and come out if you don't want to die!

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:14.010
Why isn't it working?

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:16.410
Please try entering again.

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:22.610
Let's go.

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:35.070
What...

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:37.580
What are you doing?

00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:39.840
I just went to my car.

00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:41.640
I really didn't drink.

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:42.710
Why did you run then?

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:45.450
I ran because you two ran!

00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:47.400
Damn, let go of me!

00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.240
Do you see him?

00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:56.030
See who? Is something out there?

00:59:57.610 --> 01:00:00.240
This is nuts...

01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:10.620
Let's go up.

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:18.150
Help me, please!

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.960
Ma'am! Are you okay?

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.730
I'm okay, but that couple there is...

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:46.960
Mommy, I'm fine.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.570
[Mommy, I'm fine]

[Mommy: Seo Yoon, I love you...]

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.790
Hey, hey. Now is the chance. Yes.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:36.740
Hyun Kyung must be disturbed, too.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:40.700
Let's try to have a more firm resolve.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:43.970
Hey, we have to find an apartment in two months.

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:46.820
Are you going to move into a study dorm with our children?

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:49.110
It's too small.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.660
Ahjumma, you can't leave.

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.390
Wait.

01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:03.150
Stay put. If you take off again...

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:09.080
What are you doing?

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.830
- Is something wrong?
- Be quiet.

[Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae Seok]

01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:29.850
Yoon Sae Bom, are you safe?

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:33.370
Do you now know why the lockdown is necessary?

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.960
Who, who...

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.340
It's all over for other buildings.

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.310
I know.

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:03.110
If you're in danger, don't hesitate.

01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:04.650
Don't open the door and stop them.

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:07.460
Does it make sense that they were all infected in that time?

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:10.480
What if the situation isn't over after one week?

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.710
We have to have as much food as we can gather.

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:18.120
We just have to keep the downstairs couple quiet.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.020
Are you thirsty?

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:23.760
You can't let them pity the infected. You have to make them fear them and want to run from them.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.150
Give me water!

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:29.910
If you're human, why don't you have a sense of responsibility, at least?
