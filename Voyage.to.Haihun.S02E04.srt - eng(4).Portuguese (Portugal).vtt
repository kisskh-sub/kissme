00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.300
=Episode 4=

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.760
Liu He!

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.410
Why are you here?

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.320
Something happened in Chang'an.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.200
Half of the Qilin have been taken.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.120
I learned they're coming here
to harm you.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.240
- Harm me?
- So...

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.200
Who wants to harm me?

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.430
You.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.400
Why would I harm you?

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.120
Don't you trust me?

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.270
I do.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.950
Of course, I do.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.870
It's all for the spell, isn't it?

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.470
Right?

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.400
For me,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.410
the Qilin means nothing.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.680
You don't believe me?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.120
Then take it.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.000
Lord Huo.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.910
You schemed to strip me of power,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.870
and now you hand me the Qilin.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.590
Are you mocking me?

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.920
I am Wang Heng.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.310
Wang.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.150
Qingge.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.520
This is for you.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.730
Better keep it for him.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.710
It was his all along.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.660
(Haihun Marquis's Mansion)

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.610
Wang, have some tea.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.360
It's been years.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.840
You haven't changed much.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.000
It's been eleven years already.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.150
I've grown older.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.240
Older? Not at all.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.710
You still look like a young maiden.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.630
Wang, you really know how to tease.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.870
But I enjoy hearing it.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.390
I often see Lord Yan.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:19.750
He's been doing well.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.430
He heard I'd be coming to Yuzhang,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.840
and asked me to bring you a message.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.680
All is well with him in Chang'an.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.150
He says you needn't worry.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.800
Thank you, Wang.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.560
I know my father's temper best.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.400
We've long severed all contact.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.280
Back in Chang'an, I defied his wishes,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.870
then insisted on marrying the Marquis.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.420
When did you two wed?

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.310
After I returned to Changyi,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.470
the Marquis...

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.480
(Qingge Tavern)

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.610
(Ten years ago, Changyi)
received the imperial edict.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.150
By the Ancestral Law

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.190
and the Will of Heaven,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.560
the State of Changyi

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.870
was abolished and reestablished

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.240
as Shanyang Commandery

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.150
to set titles in order

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.150
and to calm the people.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.560
Halt.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.310
I said, halt!

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.440
You...

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.750
I know who you are

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.510
and what you're up to.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.510
Get up, now.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.090
Aren't you here to keep an eye on me?

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.950
Go tell that imperial nephew of mine,

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.640
this fief was passed down
through generations.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.820
Who dares take it away?

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.750
Liu He.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.050
Milord,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.800
he's drunk and spoke rashly,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.310
but he meant no rebellion.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.190
I beg you, milord, show some mercy.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.720
Don't let word of this reach Chang'an.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.250
Chang'an?

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.750
Insolent commoner.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.220
I'll report every deed of yours
to the court

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.630
and have you charged.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.100
Go on, report it!

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.190
What's death, after all?

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.030
Come, take my life!

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.870
Liu He.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.400
Enough of this nonsense.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.800
I beg you, milord, show some mercy.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.630
Don't let these words reach Chang'an.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.920
A lady as fair as a flower.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.160
Then for the sake of your honor,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.030
I'll put the matter to rest here.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.870
- Thank you, milord.
- What is it?

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.120
Maybe kneel and beg me, young lady?

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.040
Thank I'll pretend

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.040
such matter never happened.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.390
Insolent wretch, mind your tongue!

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.270
I beg you to show mercy.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.240
Spare us, please.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.390
Spare you?

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.600
No need to do this.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.820
I alone will bear the consequences.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.830
Qingge, get up.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.800
How long will you keep this up?

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.040
How can you face them

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.040
and face yourself?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.720
I beg you to show mercy.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.750
Spare us, please.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.160
Kneel.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.560
Kneel!

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.740
Speak. Has the cat got your tongue?

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.830
These are but a commoner's foolish words.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.750
Please, milord, don't take it to heart.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.190
As a commoner,

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.950
I beg you, milord,

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.030
spare us.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:40.920
Very well.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.480
Then today, I'll let you go.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.310
After all, you are the former Emperor,

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.430
kneeling before me to apologize.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.630
Hahaha.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.540
Liu He.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.390
Come on.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.830
From that day on,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.680
the Marquis drowned his sorrows in wine.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.090
You want to drink?

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.360
Can you outdrink me?

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.560
Leave me be.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.270
Where's your dream of seeing the world,

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.510
carefree and at ease?

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.720
Isn't this what you wanted?

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.270
Then you'd best leave early.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.560
Let me be here alone.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.750
You sit here drinking alone every day.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.920
Why the solemn act?

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.070
Stay out of my business.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.650
If you can't stand it, you can leave.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.560
If not me, who else

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.520
would care for you?

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.310
Did you never care for me at all?

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.830
I'm not worth it.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.800
Right now,

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.600
I'm just a commoner,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.040
the one

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.800
will be laughed at for life.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.240
So what if you're a commoner?

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:44.120
Qingge…

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:47.960
I'm not worthy.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.910
Later, the imperial decree arrived,

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.320
granting him a post in Haihun.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.600
(Qingge Tavern)
I shut down my tavern.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:12.810
On the day of departure,

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:14.910
he appeared calm,

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.000
but deep down, he knew well

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.510
that once he left this place,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.590
he might never return to his homeland.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.540
He felt abandoned by the heavens,

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.360
which was why
he came to this remote land.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.200
Later on, we got married.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.240
That day, it was just the Marquis and me.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.960
He left a seat for each of you.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.870
Facing the empty seats,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.630
he spoke for a long time

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.030
and drank a lot of wine.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.640
He wished you all could have been there.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.370
(I never thought he'd suffered so much.)

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:54.730
Just a few days ago,

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.320
we heard that you were still alive

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.050
and was appointed
Imperial Guard Commander.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.290
I was truly happy for you.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.540
- I always...
- Wang.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.220
You don't need to explain to me.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.510
I know you have your reasons.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.940
I heard there's a lady by your side,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.420
brave and skilled in battle.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:13.770
I wonder if that's true.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.030
It is indeed De Jiu.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.390
At times, I truly envy her.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.840
She lives freely

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.960
and able to do whatever she wishes.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.670
I don't even know what I truly want.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.840
Why?

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.580
Has he treated you poorly?

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:30.840
He treats me very well.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:33.720
It's just...

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.390
we know each other too well.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.800
Qingge,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.910
I think he's merely...

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.000
Wang, let's not speak of this.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.840
Just now, I saw you hurrying over.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.960
You looked worried.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:48.470
Is something urgent?

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.960
I heard someone
plotting against the Marquis.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.870
So I rushed here.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.690
Is there anything suspicious lately?

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.320
Anything suspicious?

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.360
Since the Marquis returned
from Chang'an,

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.790
he's been deeply shaken.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.720
He drinks from dawn till dusk.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.940
After we married,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.230
he drank less.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.950
But once we came to Yuzhang,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.130
he started drinking again.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.790
Lately, he often wakes at night,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.860
muttering to himself.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.620
No matter how I call, he won't answer.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.760
It sounds like he's sleepwalking.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.750
Never wake him suddenly.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.000
The consequences could be dire.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.080
Mm.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.630
Oh, right.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.300
Why has he begun
building his own tomb?

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.750
He said he doesn't have much time left.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.400
I'm at a complete loss.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.590
How strange...

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.330
Has the Marquis met anyone suspicious?

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.300
He seldom associates with others.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.200
Only Uncle Li brings calming remedies.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.360
- Uncle Li?
- Mm.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.200
He came as well.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.870
Madam,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.960
the Marquis's medicine is ready.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.840
Uncle Li.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.790
Lord Wang, I must've been blind.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.000
I failed to recognize you.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.070
I'm sorry, milord.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.040
You speak too formally.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.780
Besides, you are my elder.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.860
Back in the equine administration,
you treated my injury.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.080
Please don't bring that up.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.180
It makes me uneasy.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.780
Tonight, I'll deliver the med
to the Marquis.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.680
Wang,

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.240
let Uncle Li handle this.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.920
The Marquis might get upset seeing you.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.420
I'll trouble you.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.670
Yes, madam.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.420
I know you're worried about him.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.540
He will be fine.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.140
Everything will be fine.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.200
I just hope it's only sleepwalking.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.580
My lord,

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.700
if there's something weighing on you,

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.630
you can tell me.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.540
Wang Heng, Lord Wang.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.820
He's returned.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.220
He asked me to find out the Qilin code.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:45.860
Rest assured,

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.100
I will convey it truthfully to him.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.580
Do you still not trust me?

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.540
The Qilin code.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.550
Qilin...

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.420
code...

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:08.660
Wang Heng,

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.080
I'm not telling you.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.860
So you won't leave.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.430
Do you think I'd tell you now?

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.480
Huh?

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.220
Hahaha.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.300
As your guard, I'm always at the ready.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.080
You had too much to drink?

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.900
I'll keep the Marquis safe.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.940
I am very much safe.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.460
(I used to call him a fool often.)

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.520
(Now he truly became one.)

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.060
Eat slowly.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:54.860
