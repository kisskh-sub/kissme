=Episode 19=

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.200
Night after night,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.760
watching over her in silence.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.640
All mute.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.120
I'll wake her up.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.920
You can't wake her.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.880
She's pretending.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.600
Pretending is better.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.240
At least this way,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.600
I can stay by her side forever.

00:00:48.243 --> 00:00:49.120
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.720
Hong'er, where are you?

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.200
Hong'er.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.640
Hong'er.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.520
You found me!

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.160
You're amazing!

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.040
So impressive!

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.880
Young lady.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.120
Young lady,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.720
don't leave.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.120
Hello,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.200
I'm Lin Hong'er.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.120
Lady Lin.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920
This is Xiao Xian, the Prince Heir.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.480
You two make a perfect pair.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.440
Why stay?

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.720
You're no needed here.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.560
Liuyun.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.440
I...

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.600
She's not lying.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.440
Do you like him?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.000
What about you?

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.440
Do you like her too?

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.880
The one I like

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.920
is Lin Hong'er.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.600
Good! Good!

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.520
I am Lin Hong'er.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:03.296
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.080
(The one I like)

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.040
is Lin Hong'er.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.960
Heaven's justice prevails.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.680
(May the guilty be punished.)

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.120
(Here rest Lin Sanjiang and his wife)
(May the departed rest in peace.)

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.320
A person's appearance

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.800
can't be completely altered.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.800
Xiao Xian mentioned

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.000
the County Princess studied
unorthodox medical techniques.

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:52.200
(Medical Book)

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.720
The Flesh Worm

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.920
can make one's appearance

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.960
change drastically.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.760
Hong'er.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.000
Hong'er.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.880
Hong'er.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.480
Why have you changed, Hong'er?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.520
Hong'er.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.200
Who's in there?

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:16.040
County Princess's library

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.928
is off-limits to all.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.120
Keep watch.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.320
Understood.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.320
Hong Linlang...

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.160
Lin Hong'er...

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.200
Hong Linlang is Lin Hong'er.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.160
Aren't you mad?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.960
It looks smooth and delicate,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.840
but upon touch,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.520
there seem to be layers of scars

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.360
hidden beneath this delicate skin.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.640
I'm not Lin Hong'er.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.440
You are.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.040
What?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.320
Planning your defense?

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.800
Yes.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.280
I'm Lin Hong'er.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.920
Though I look nothing like her,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.800
I am her essence.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.080
Why would I need defense?

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.160
Don't forget

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.280
you're currently a madwoman.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.200
Such horrific claims

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.000
coming from a lunatic

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.080
will only make people think

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.440
you're truly mad.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200
You're right.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.600
I'm a madwoman.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.280
No one believes a madwoman's words.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.480
None will believe.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.200
No one ever believes...

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.400
What's her true purpose here?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.560
I'm such a fool.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.840
I failed to recognize you
as Lin Hong'er.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.480
I failed to recognize you.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.080
(I interrogated those jailers.)

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.600
(Under Magistrate He Laijin's orders,)

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.200
(they used inhuman methods
to torture Lin Hong'er)

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.040
(to extract every detail
of her encounters with you.)

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.640
(So Xu Ziyi could
impersonate her perfectly.)

00:06:11.968 --> 00:06:13.344
(Testimony)

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.000
Your Highness.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.440
Your Highness.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.600
You've returned, Your Highness.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.440
Stop pretending madness.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Kill me.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.040
Instead of living burdened by sin,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.040
I might as well die in your hand.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.280
You truly deserve to die.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.440
Do you know what she's been through?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.720
Do you know how much she's suffered?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.600
Do you think my life
has been any better?

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.160
Do you think my heart

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.680
hasn't been tormented day and night?

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.840
Do you know the only thing
I can't let go of?

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.960
It's that I genuinely love you.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.600
What pains me most

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.200
is that I deceived you.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.240
That's why I chose

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.760
to let you discover the truth.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.360
My only wish is that after I die,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.720
you can reunite with her.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.640
Why?

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.600
Killing you

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.760
would only dirty my sword.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.640
Since that's the case,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.680
let me live to atone for my sins.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.840
I heard Lin Hong'er
is faking her pregnancy.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.880
If that's true,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.240
she'll surely be executed.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.040
Take her away
from the mansion immediately.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.320
Flee far away.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.960
Your Highness, you got great taste.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.840
Pearls?

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.120
Are these all?

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.096
Yes.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.800
Are we really

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.560
proceeding with this marriage?

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.960
My mother had two children.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.680
One was the late Prince Rui,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.360
and the other is me.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.240
So Prince Xian's father was...

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.280
An illegitimate child of unknown birth.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.520
That's why both the late Prince Rui
and I hold titles,

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.360
but Xiao Xian's father

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.760
was just a commoner.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.920
If Prince Xian marries a mad wife,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.000
His Majesty will never
let him inherit the title.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.360
But what if Lady Hong's child
isn't a son?

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.280
How is it?

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.800
Very good.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.600
Take a look.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.760
Pick what you like.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.280
Don't eat this.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.240
Prince Xian, you're here.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.680
Perfect timing.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.520
Let's review the list together.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.800
Come here.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.520
I'll handle it.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.040
Your Highness,

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.240
let's review over there.

00:10:13.536 --> 00:10:14.080
Come.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.640
This side has a better view.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.224
Hurry.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.320
Come on.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.400
Sit here.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.920
Look,

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.320
we've prepared many items.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.640
Sit down.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.480
Enough.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.960
This is women's business.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.640
You shouldn't stay here.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:40.920
Great.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.160
I need to speak with Lady Hong.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.520
I'll take my leave.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.560
Your Highness,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.680
I suddenly feel unwell.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.280
I must excuse myself.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.240
Stop!

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.120
Your fiancée is mad.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.760
Does that mean you can publicly

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.800
discard all decency?

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.000
You and my father are sworn enemies.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.320
I've known it since childhood.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.200
Your purpose in coming here

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.360
is to keep me
from inheriting the title, isn't it?

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.800
If I lose face,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.200
doesn't that serve your purpose?

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:17.840
You...

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.488
You...

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.040
- Let go of me!
- Listen to me!

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.120
- Let go of me!
- Listen to me!

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.840
What do you want?

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.920
I beg you. Listen to me!

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.880
Listen!

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.280
I know everything now.
