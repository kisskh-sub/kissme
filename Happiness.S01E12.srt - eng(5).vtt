You're the one who sent me Seo Yoon's letter, right?

I was only able to get this far because of it.

Without that, I would have ended up like my husband.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.810
Oppa, say something!

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.520
Really, no one else is here.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.460
- Doctor!
- Come on!

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.640
- Open the door! Open the door!
- But who...

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.350
did that to him?

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.620
- Damn it!
- Please open the door!

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.900
Open the door! Open up!

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.650
Do you think you'll survive after everyone else dies?

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:01.570
I will set your unit on fire!

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.050
Darn it.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.470
Open it!

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.060
D-Doctor?

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.760
Are you okay?

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.020
Hey, you saw that, too, right?

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:03.760
He was shot in the arm and the leg, but the bleeding has already stopped.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.240
That's a good thing. What's the problem?

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.600
The smell of his blood disgusts me,

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.560
and I don't want it. He's infected.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.370
What about my blood then? Did you want mine?

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:21.570
Can you just listen to me and not change the subject? I'm saying he's infected!

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.100
I don't hear you denying it.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.000
How could you want your sister's blood? What kind of brother are you?

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.860
Oh...

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.050
Oh, are you okay?

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.050
- Get some water.
- Okay.

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.240
What are you two doing here?

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:48.160
You kept bleeding, and there was nothing I could do by myself.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.190
I put that on him in case he had an attack.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.950
Don't you feel thirsty?

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.850
It's not as bad these days.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:05.830
I do feel thirsty

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:10.090
but diabetes runs in our family.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.610
Where is Sae Bom?

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.900
What? She's not in the building.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.840
The other detective and the girl are gone, too.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.070
They left, didn't they?

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.630
The news said everything was fine outside.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:31.370
I heard martial law has been lifted except for the areas in lockdown.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.260
Maybe the door to the outside is open or something.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.240
I don't know what's going on outside, either.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.590
Oh, don't move! You have two gunshot wounds.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.860
I bit Andrew.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.580
What?

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.360
He's a murderer and even more dangerous if he's infected.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.680
If he's alive,

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.260
I have to catch him.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.670
Help him.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.980
What?

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:55.590
Let's look for him on our way down before there are more victims.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:28:00.470
While the Central Disease Relief Center is minimizing the spread of infection with quick diagnosis and bold lockdowns,

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.770
it looks like the prevention of Madness Rabies seems plausible.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:09.390
According to the insider, the current vaccine that's in clinical trials is showing a meaningful efficacy rate.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:13.060
And if positive results are produced, they will request immediate

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.570
approval for usage with the Federal Health Department.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:21.030
- Drink some of this. You have to eat something to gain strength.
- Considering the danger of spreading the infection, the government decided to

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:25.120
maintain the quarantine of the infected until the treatment therapy has been developed.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.400
Based on that, the nursing homes and apartments that are currently in lockdown

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.910
will continue for now.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.710
And the residents in the region...

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.350
Oh, look. The brave Detective is here.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:53.440
You must've gotten hurt in the electricity room.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.760
Are there people with injuries inside?

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.070
The cleaner couple from the second floor.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:03.030
He got stabbed by Andrew, so I'm treating him on a humanitarian level.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.270
I don't see Andrew nor the building representative.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.620
Do you know where they are?

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.060
They must have gone out.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.560
Where is your wife?

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.820
Andrew is dangerous right now.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.090
Don't ever open the door for him.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:23.650
If possible, I'm thinking of bringing criminal charges against the three of you.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:26.190
The couple from across the hallway in unit 602...

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:29.720
Sang Hee and that attorney fell for each other. Look at this.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.070
She did this to me.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.780
Shouldn't you catch them and lock them away first?

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.430
We already stopped by unit 602.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:41.650
That attorney ahjussi showed us where you bit his arm.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:45.200
That's right. I'm infected,

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.530
but there are so many people who have been infected.

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:52.280
Do you think anyone will punish me for biting someone?

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.960
Oh Joo Hyung.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.540
You're not infected.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.140
I know because I am.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.480
I'm barely holding back the urge to bite you.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.710
I took the pill, too. I took the pill, too!

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.240
You don't always get infected by taking the pill.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:20.460
Some get infected much later, and some don't even get infected.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.710
Where is your husband?

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:35.980
His condition keeps deteriorating. Is there anything you can do for him?

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.610
Of course, his condition isn’t good

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.810
when he has a knife stuck in his body.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:46.360
Honey, I’m okay. I’ll get up soon.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:50.060
So tell him to get out of here! Please!

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.570
Ahjussi, this is my place!

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.460
How long can he last?

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.230
He’ll die right away if you pull out the knife,

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.430
and if you leave it in, about two days or so?

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:22.440
I’ll look for a way to get him out. Look after his wounds in the meantime.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:27.080
I gave him painkillers and even gave up my bedroom. What more do you want me to do?

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:38.600
You're keeping them both here in case you get thirsty for blood, aren't you?

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.240
Who do you think I am? What nonsense are you spewing?

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.890
Have you been taking those pills?

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.370
Is that why you thought you were infected?

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:59.630
Yes, I was going to have them as my lunch! So what? I took the pills because I thought I might die!

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.990
Just concentrate on treating him instead.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.700
If you create one more issue,

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.480
I’ll lock you up in the basement.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.290
What proof do you have to lock me up?

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:13.800
Are you the judge? Hey! Hey!

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:37.220
Honey. This.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.150
Try this.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.970
If you take this pill, the wound is supposed to heal quickly.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.780
Did you drink?

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.250
You do love me, don’t you?

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.190
Don't bite me, even if you get infected.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.230
Sir, are you okay?

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:23.580
Oh, of course, I am!

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:28.060
You don’t look so well, either, though.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.470
- How is your wife doing?
- We’re fine,

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:37.440
so please just take good care of my son.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.080
Isn’t Kim Dong Hyun back yet?

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:46.740
What? Isn’t he on the 2nd floor?

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.420
He did say he wanted to go out.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:02.060
If you happen to see him, please tell him to come home, since we’re okay.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.030
A home is...

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.610
there for you to go to when things get hard.

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.830
I understand.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:12.340
By chance, if Andrew…

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:17.800
If you see an unfamiliar young guy, don’t ever open the door to him.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.010
He’s very dangerous.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.080
Oh, okay.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.720
But why would he come here?

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.720
There are only two old folks living here.

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.660
Sir, do you have enough food?

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:33.230
Would you like us to bring you some more?

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:40.280
Why would you offer him food when we don’t have enough for us?

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.870
I’m going to give them some of mine!

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.570
Why are you so selfish?

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.370
The two of you, move aside.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.980
That guy is infected.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:13.760
I saw him biting Andrew.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.950
I’m infected, too.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.590
Let’s not fight, Building Representative.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.930
There’s a good chance Andrew is still in the building.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.220
Andrew is dead.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:04.940
I was going to go out and meet with the person in charge of the blockade, but the infected are right in front of the building.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:09.070
Still, we caught the murderer so all we have to do is wait quietly.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:13.920
Did you get rid of Andrew’s body then?

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:17.100
It’s on the rooftop.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.860
You're the one who bit him and killed him!

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:24.010
There’s no one on the rooftop.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.410
You must be trying to fool me,

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:33.140
but do I look like an idiot? No way!

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:39.010
I’m normal. I’m different from you infected people!

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:45.000
It’s dangerous if you go alone, Building Representative.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:54.560
Is it okay to leave that ahjumma alone?

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.210
She lost her family.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.750
I’m sure she needs someone to hate.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.230
Oh, my head hurts...

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.850
The police bastard hid Andrew’s body. He's lying to me.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.770
I'll just kill him if I have to.

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:57.890
Andrew and Kim Dong Hyun must both have left.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.220
What?

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.210
Wait...

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:26.060
Oh, don’t do that! What if the infected get in?

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.910
Don’t come out.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.880
Are you okay?

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:08.960
How long has it been since you got bit?

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.150
Hey, isn’t that the jobless guy from the 3rd floor?

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.380
It looks like he got hurt.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.500
Hurt? He got bit!

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:37.250
Well, um...

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:41.360
isn't he infected?

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.470
He hasn't had an episode yet.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:49.340
If he stays with his family, he might be able to endure better.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:20.200
Dad, I'm sorry.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.760
Oh no...

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:33.080
Honey!

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.450
Dong Hyun is back!

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:59.560
Moon Hee.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.120
Yes?

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:06.200
Are you okay? Do you feel better?

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.230
It hurts less.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:10.750
Who gave you those pills?

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:18.180
Should I… try taking the knife out?

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.180
Hold on.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.190
Do you have more pills?

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.210
Give me the water.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.250
Let’s try removing it.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.530
I’m going to pull it out.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.930
Moon Hee, you know…

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.970
I don’t think I can leave empty-handed after ending up like this.

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:01.170
Let’s take this apartment.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.160
How?

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.860
Sir…

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:26.370
What is it? Is he dead?

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.490
I pulled out the knife.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:34.240
I told you not to! Did he bleed all over the floor?

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.230
Why don’t you people listen?

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:45.420
Sir. You don’t have any family, right?

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.330
Aigoo,

00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:00.190
doesn’t it look more swollen than before?

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:04.250
Oppa, how many times do I have to tell you no?

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.810
Are you sure?

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:09.220
I already told you!

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.810
Stop touching it! That’s why it’s getting more swollen!

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:17.690
You really think I’m fine, right?

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.210
What do we do about the bitcoin?

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:24.630
I have the passcode but not the laptop.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.210
The laptop!

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:36.170
Sang Hee! I’ll give you the money, so open the door!

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.340
Sang Hee! Open the door!

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.960
- Sang Hee!
- Maybe he’s doing that so he can bite us.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.630
I’ll give you the money!

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.510
How much?

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:52.740
Hey, that cleaner bastard has totally gone nuts!

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.590
Get away!

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.600
If Go Se Gyoo’s condition becomes critical, we’ll have to get him out somehow.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.190
We can't leave him to die.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:09.500
Detective Jung!

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.350
Detective Jung, help me! I almost died.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.750
What is it now?

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:25.420
He gave us the pills. He said the wound will heal if he takes it.

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.960
Are you nuts? That's not true. I'm not crazy!

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.350
Why would I increase the number of monsters?

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:34.180
Is your husband okay?

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:37.910
He's still struggling. He's lying down right now.

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:40.860
Can't you kick that man out somewhere?

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.570
I'm too scared to have him in here with us.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:46.680
You have to kick these people out if anything!

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:51.440
Why don't you believe me? We're both residents of this building!

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:56.240
It's the first time hearing you say that we're both residents of this building.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.350
I warned you, didn't I?

00:44:58.350 --> 00:44:59.710
Let's go to the gym.

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:03.210
My laptop, laptop. Tell them to give me my laptop.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:06.690
Laptop! My laptop!

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.980
Are you happy that I'm leaving?

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:36.040
What are you doing right now? Where are you taking the doctor?

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.200
I'm planning to quarantine him.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:42.500
Watch yourself if you don't want to end up like this, too.

00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:00.460
Honey, all this is ours, right?

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.900
Of course. You said that bastard doesn't have any family.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.600
He nearly killed me.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.990
We can ask him to compensate us for damages with this apartment.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:14.540
He'd never agree to it.

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:20.420
We can get rid of him before the lockdown lifts. They'll think one of the infected killed him.

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.180
Right?

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.940
Oh, Moon Hee... Moon Hee...

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:30.190
- Get me some water.
- Oh, okay.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.750
Just take this, too.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.400
I'm thirsty for some strange reason.

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.450
How many are there?

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:10.340
One,

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:13.360
two,

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.040
three...

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:32.830
Why didn't you leave with your wife?

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:40.960
I have to watch the house until she comes back.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:46.420
It took a lot of effort to get this place through special provisions for civil servants.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:55.710
I know that you were worried about us, too.

00:47:55.710 --> 00:48:01.630
If you hadn't stayed behind, something bad would have happened.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:04.880
Thank you.

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:13.810
I'll get some rest and then look for Andrew one more time.

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.950
It could be dangerous, so both of you should go home.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:19.870
We can help.

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.670
I could be dangerous to you, too.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:30.580
Your brother seems to have gotten a lot better, but not me.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.030
Hey...

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.170
Be safe.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.520
Bom.

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.210
Are you well?

00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:57.470
I miss you.

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:27.060
We survived thanks to Jung Yi Hyun.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.720
He is infected, but—

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.350
Then he's home, right?

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.170
It's dangerous, so don't go outside and stay home!

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:36.680
The lockdown will lift soon!

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.320
What? Really?

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.150
See? She says not to go outside!

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.580
Hey, that's amazing.

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:04.400
Hey! Sang Hee. I knew you would come!

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.390
Let go.

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:10.080
Let go and talk.

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.930
What can you do without a key?

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:15.830
Building Representative, please help me.

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.230
I only came to help him.

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.760
You must be crazy!

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.850
Wouldn't it be better for us to get rid of that detective bastard?

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:32.740
His wife ran away, so we just need to get rid of that bastard.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:38.380
Do you want us to kill a detective?

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:41.010
He's infected.

00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:48.040
I'll break that for you with this, so do as I tell you.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.940
Help me!

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.000
Oh Joo Hyung.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.910
Calm down, and let go of her.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:30.370
Jung Yi Hyun, let's kill all the uninfected people

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:33.440
and say that everything happened because of the disease.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:38.880
That's right. The monsters did everything.

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:43.250
You guys are the monsters, not the infected people!

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.430
Aren't you thirsty?

00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:01.920
Should we find out who the real monster is?

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:23.960
Jung Yi Hyun! Jung Yi Hyun!

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.520
Don't you love the smell of blood?

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.360
Don't hold it in! You must have lived your whole life holding it in!

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.860
Jung Yi Hyun! Jung Yi Hyun!

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.060
Come out! Come out!

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:36.600
Come out!

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.620
Come out!

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.790
Why won't everyone listen to me?

00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:48.460
This is my building. Listen to me!

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:57.350
Calm down! I'm not here to arrest you!

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:03.880
You killed my husband.

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.560
I even captured a murderer, and I'm not infected, either.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.220
I'm qualified to be Resident Representative.

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:13.290
Okay. When you're released from jail, I'll vote for you.

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.250
- Okay.
- Come out, come out!

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:18.670
Come out!

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:22.270
Just come, bite me and change!

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:25.350
I'll have an episode soon, too!

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.710
You're dead.

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:52.300
Hyun...

00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:00.360
I'm here.

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:19.440
I realized it when I heard what you said.

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:26.840
What matters in a home is who you are with.

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.860
I plan to be with you in the future.

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:40.270
Stay with me.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:24.480
I don't care what state you're in.

00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:40.660
Are you sure there is an antibody carrier inside the apartment building?

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.240
There was a testimony.

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:46.250
Please tell me everything you know about the infected.

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:49.210
We may need the information to develop a treatment.

00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:51.960
There's not much that I know,

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:56.900
but Na Hyun Kyung said that her brother's wound stayed the same.

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:59.780
That it didn't get worse or better.

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.920
Did you ask for full authority solely based on that?

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.750
Ji Soo.

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:09.440
Did we ever have anything we can rely on?

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:34.900
Oppa, open the door, please. I got the bitcoins!

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.080
It has been tough, hasn't it?

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.220
I'm sorry that I've been so sensitive.
[So Yoon, did you make it out okay? I'm sorry. I realized how precious you are to me, now that you're gone...]

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:44.820
I mean, we did all that to be happy.
[So Yoon, did you make it out okay? I'm sorry. I realized how precious you are to me, now that you're gone...]

Honey! I'm telling you, we can be happy now!

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.010
- Open the door!
- So-So Yoon? So Yoon...

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:02.770
- I'm really sorry. It's all my fault. Please?
- Oppa!

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:04.390
Don't ever call me again.

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:06.130
- No, no, no, I...
- Oppa...

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:07.620
You're in there, right?

00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:11.410
I've been repenting. Honestly.

00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:12.930
Can you hear me?

00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:14.690
- So–
- Open the door for a second.

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:17.080
Gosh, but I really have been repenting.

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:21.270
I'm telling you, we can be happy now. Oppa?

00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:24.910
- The call is not going through...
- Geez...

00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:35.480
We were happy together. We can be even happier.

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:41.300
Open the door. Please? Open it.

00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:44.970
Fine. I'll have to take the next best thing.

00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.550

00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:01.990
Oppa, I'll give you some coins.

Various economic indicators and outlooks are still dim.

In our nation, as well as globally, the stock markets continue to fall.

More than 30 stocks declining in value were listed in the Korean stock market today.
[Stocks fall endlessly due to spread of Madness Rabies]

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:55.070
- The price of crude oils, gold, and various raw materials has fallen.
- Honey...

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:56.940
The international crude oil price is $80 per barrel...

01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:00.340
I'm sure the cure will be out soon.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:04.310
It will be developed in no time.

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:09.670
The health department could suddenly come and ring our doorbell to help us!

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:11.250
The drop in the value will continue to drop

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:14.000
and the market capitalization of the virtual currency market

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.620
- compared to three months ago, 97.5%...
- What...

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:21.600
Oh, my God! Aigoo!

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:24.490
H-Hey...

01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:28.010
Mom, they're here. We'll live now!

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:30.380
- I was right!
- Aigoo!

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.580
I told you they would come! I told you so!

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:36.580
- Aigoo!
- Be gentle...

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.520
Aigoo!

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.720
Take it.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.740
Thank you!

01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:51.880
No, I never bit anyone.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.120
I'm telling you the truth.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.440
I'm not thirsty, either.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.500
Try giving me some water. It's true. I don't get thirsty.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.970
It's true. I never bit anyone.

01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:04.220
He has been perfectly fine. He could have recovered completely.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.370
I think he's actually recovered. Right, Oppa, you're all better now, right?

01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:09.630
Yes, since I'm not thirsty.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.460
Nothing's wrong with him, right? He's fine, isn't he?

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:22.950
- I don't get thirsty.
- Don't talk too much!

01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:25.780
Yes, I'm being honest!

01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:32.910
We found the antibody carrier. We're returning now.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.510
I'll take care of Yoon Sae Bom.

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:42.230
Do what you need to do. Just bring in the antibody carrier.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.800
Be careful with him.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:52.330
Take Yoon Sae Bom and Jung Yi Hyun to the dorm.

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:53.870
Yes, Sir.

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.910
No! No!

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:57.860
This is our home! What are you doing?

01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.760
No! No!

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.740
Honey! Look at this! No! It's our apartment!

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.460
No, it's our apartment!

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.040
No! No!

01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.140
No!

01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:13.740
This is our home!

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.270
- No!
- It's mine!

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:17.190
- This is our apartment!
- Let go! It's mine!

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:18.830
This is our place! Let go!

01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:20.630
No! This is ours!

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:23.980
It's ours! Let go of me!

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.750
- I'm going to take it with me!
- It's ours!

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:28.380
- I said it's mine!
- This is our home!

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:34.850
Just stay here. It's too bad if it's hot.

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:39.430
Don't you dare think this is the end! Remember!

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:44.070
Sae Bom, you'll vote for me, right?

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.940
Sure. Let's go.

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:07.660
We shouldn't leave Kim Se Hoon here, right?

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:11.060
Let's move him to his place.

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.230
I'll go open the door.

01:04:43.690 --> 01:04:46.300
Call Yoon Sae Bom here.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.990
Drop the gun, Yoon Sae Bom.

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:17.620
Just shoot him. I can take a hit.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.810
Drop the gun if you want him to live!

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:25.340
Never. Just shoot him now!

01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:57.480
It's fresh blood.

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:44.360
Yi Hyun.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.890

told you that I was going to be the bad cop.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.170
You...

01:07:01.170 --> 01:07:02.600

Yi Hyun!

01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:30.010
No. Yi Hyun!

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.880

♫ And just forget the world ♫

01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:37.800

01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:25.610
Aren't you tired after all that running?

01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:28.330
- I'm not tired at all.
- Really?

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:30.930
Then shall we take it up a notch?

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:32.100
How about the gym?

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.800
All the residents can use the facility now.

01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:42.670
- I have plans, so I have to go back home.
- What?

01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:43.940
Bye!

01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:45.960
Which plans?

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.590
Seo Yoon.

01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:50.800
All right. Shall we go then?

01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:00.720
What are you thinking?

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:05.440
Last year when we were locked up here.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.640
It was tough, wasn't it?

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.570
A little.

01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:13.010
But it was okay because you were with me.

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:20.360
When did you start liking me?

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.080
Since the beginning, I told you. Why don't you believe me?

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.940
I said to myself that you were my destiny, that I'll be with you forever.

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:31.510
So you never gave up?

01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:33.100
Why do you think I became a cop?

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:36.880
Hey! Don't tell me you became a cop because of me!

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.060
I thought about going to the States, but I couldn't stop thinking about what you said.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:45.520
You said our future was full of choices, so I should do whatever I wanted. But then you went with the SOU!

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.430
Hey, I had no idea.

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:54.390
So are you happy now?

01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:00.620
Of course. Only when I'm with you.

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:03.690
I'm not that happy otherwise.

01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:05.600
Stop lying.

01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:10.210
The first one home will be exempt from recycling duty for a week!

01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:11.820
You're cheating! Hey!

01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:13.630
Including the food garbage!

01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:14.940
