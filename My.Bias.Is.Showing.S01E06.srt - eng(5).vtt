00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.020
It doesn't make sense, does it?

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.490
I'm just a nobody.
Who am I to date Siyeol?

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.260
People would just
call me crazy and delusional.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.940
What are you talking about?

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.840
Na Aejoon!

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.710
Don't belittle yourself!

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.260
I'm only reacting like this...

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.660
because I don't think
I've ever heard him say he likes someone.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.780
That's why.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.360
So. it's really true that
he's never been in a relationship?

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.830
What?

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.490
That's what he said in his last interview.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.420
He's been working since he was a trainee,

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.660
so he never had time to date.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.070
I don't know about before,
but since I've become his manager, yes.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.360
Wow.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.550
Is that why he was so awkward and cute?

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.390
There was once when I forgot to text him.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.770
The atmosphere was really weird,

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.080
so I asked him if something bad happened,

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.050
and he came to me,

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.400
asking why I didn't reply to him!
I was so surprised,

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.470
so I checked my phone,

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.230
and he really texted me first!

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.370
So, I was like "I'm so sorry.
I was too busy with work."

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.930
Okay.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.100
This hoodie...
No, this is not it.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.880
Hmm... this is too wild.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.930
Nothing beats the clean-cut look.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.190
Okay!

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.650
Oh, you're here.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.690
I just got here too.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.620
My place is a bit messy, right?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.620
That's not it.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.230
Here.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.640
A formal housewarming gift.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:52.480
[No matter how I look at him,
he is always so insanely handsome!]

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.310
Congratulations on the new release, A-One.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.520
Don't you feel stuffy?

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.140
Want a T-shirt or something?

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.200
No, I'm fine.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.090
It's embarrassing to watch that with you.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.170
I think that was filmed
right before the new release.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.090
No.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.900
It's to commemorate your third anni...

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.220
I think that's it.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.300
I've never seen this before,

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.210
but the date of the broadcast fits.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.570
Aren't we the closest?

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.820
Yes, we are. Truly.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:38.440
By the way, Jooha and you
must've really relied on each other.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.970
Sorry?

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:44.190
Oh... Well, yes, I guess so.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.910
He only transitioned into acting
because of the accident.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.330
That must've been so upsetting.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.350
It wasn't even what he wanted.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.010
Oh!

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.840
I'm sorry.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.210
You know him way better than I do.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.440
Who am I to comment on it?

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.760
Why are you always apologizing?

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.860
The food's done.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.100
Have a seat.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.660
How can he be so perfectly pretty?

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.950
He's born to be an actor.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.370
You're prettier.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.100
[Not again.]

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.650
[Blurting it out before I realize it.]

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.990
Wow, you made all this food so quickly?

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.600
Amazing.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.960
You brought the perfect wine
for these dishes.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.210
But

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.050
can you handle it today?

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.819
What? Sorry?

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:16.339
I mean... You brought me wine again.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.410
I thought maybe you wanted us to

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:24.470
reminisce about the unforgettable night

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.589
we spent together.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:28.290
No!

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.570
No, no, that's not what I meant.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.760
Since we're on this topic,

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.960
that day, we...

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.890
Well...

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.380
Want to know how far we went?

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.190
Actually, I don't remember anything,

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.900
but I got a hickey.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.940
A hickey?

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.060
Wait, so that is

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.500
what's been bugging you this whole time...

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.740
That day,

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.330
you kept scratching
because of your nut allergy.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.550
So, I made sure there aren't nuts

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.150
in any dishes today.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.530
Oh...

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.440
So I was worried over nothing...

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.240
This is embarrassing.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.320
That day,

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.080
nothing happened between us.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.360
I know.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.570
I was just overthinking things.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.150
I didn't want it to be hasty

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.070
and forgettable.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.140
I hope our first kiss

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.350
will linger on

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.540
in your memory.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.380
Jooha?

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.100
I'm sorry.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.600
I didn't know you'd have a guest.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:24.340
[In the next episode]

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.770
Can't you stay for the night?

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.940
We can go to work together tomorrow.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.570
I always feel like I'm lying to him.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:31.940
Before we take things further,

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.390
I should come clean with Siyeol.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.510
Our guest today is

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:37.360
the ever-popular group, A-One.
Welcome!

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.340
This is the first time
I've mentioned this on camera.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.110
Hey, Choi Siyeol!

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.630
Do you like Yeon Jooha?

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.500
Just leave Jooha alone.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.220
Was it your plan all along?

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.630
Answer me, Choi Siyeol.
