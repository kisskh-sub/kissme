00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:11.159
What's going on here?

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:16.719
Look at you. I told you to find someone
and you still messed it up.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.520
All you ever do is eat and sleep.
What else can you do?

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.439
I'm sorry, Madam.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.680
It really isn't my fault.

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.079
These gentlemen

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.479
said the pay was too low
and refused to help.

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:30.078
They complained the pay was too low?

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.679
Look at these beggars.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.318
You're in no place to complain!

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.639
What did you just call me, woman?

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.798
What, did I hit a nerve?

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.118
Go on, try laying a hand on me.

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.559
Do you even know who I am?

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.599
Look at the way she is dressed.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.399
We can't afford to cross her. Calm down.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.518
Why is it so noisy outside?

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:45.679
Don't worry about it.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.640
What are you afraid of?
Go check it out.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.120
- Come on.
- Let's go.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.999
Listen up.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.880
My car's stuck outside.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.120
Whoever helps me push it out

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.040
gets an extra ten silver dollars.

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:17.639
Oh Madam,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.479
you don't need to spend
that much to push a car.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.560
Such a waste.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.239
You've been married
into our family for years

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.719
and you're still so stingy
and embarrassing.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.919
I can afford more if I have to.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.199
You two go as well.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.040
Whoever pushes it out gets another ten.

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.719
- I'll go!
- Me too.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.318
- It's mine!
- Mine!

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.358
That one looks good.

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.239
He seems strong.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.358
You go in a bit.

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:37.559
It's mine, give it to me.

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:41.039
Careful, Madam.

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:45.879
Hurry up.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.319
Stop fighting, give it here.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.879
It's mine, stop fighting.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.999
Didn't I tell you to stay put?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.239
It was too dangerous.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.599
If I hadn't stepped in,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.119
we wouldn't have gotten through.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.879
Second Master, I got the goods.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.239
But I don't know what it is.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:15.759
It's tungsten ore.

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.359
Tungsten ore is military material.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.440
What exactly is Pei Yujie planning?

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.838
Have Wen Yuan check

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.239
where that warehouse shipped to
in the last five years.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240
Understood.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.300
(Pei Residence)

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.679
Uncle, Miss Du, you're back so late.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.120
Where did you go?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400
What,

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.118
do we need to tell the younger ones

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:49.879
every time we go out for fun?

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.200
The Master just returned

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.439
and sent a lot of men to Jiang City.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.280
Looks like a big move this time.

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.039
When you and Miss Du go out to have fun,

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.999
you'd better be careful.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.140
(Longevity with Grace)

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.278
Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.038
The Master said that

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.999
no one may enter without his permission.

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:23.679
Not even me?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.720
That's right.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.920
Look at this.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:48.159
This...

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.278
When did this happen?

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.359
These photos were found this morning.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.318
You didn't take these?

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:08.719
Then who did?

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.239
Whoever it was,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.520
at least he's helping us
against Pei Yuze for now.

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:16.318
This is a critical moment.

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:17.479
Nothing can go wrong.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.600
The second branch must be eliminated.

00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:24.719
So it really is Lian Xinruo.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.760
If I had known, I should have
shot her dead back then.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.080
Since she is Lian Xinruo,

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.439
that makes things easier.

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.719
What are you planning now?

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.598
A ticket for
tonight's ship to Gang City.

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:10.598
Everything is arranged.

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:12.159
Someone will meet you there.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.358
You must leave quickly

00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:14.479
or you'll be in danger.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.880
What are you talking about?

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.279
Why should I leave?

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.079
I have no plans to go away right now.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.000
Xin...

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:22.399
Youmeng, listen to me.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.439
The matter in Jiang City is huge.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.919
Pei Yujie won't allow
the slightest error.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.758
I used to pass you clues.

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.078
But now, even I can't get information.

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:32.919
If you don't leave, it'll be too late.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.760
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:36.278
If that's all you have to say,

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.838
I'm leaving.

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:38.279
Stop being so stubborn.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.280
Do you think Pei Yuze can protect you?

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.520
Whether I can protect her

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.480
is not for you to decide.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.240
Xinruo, I would never harm you.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.959
Pei Yuze.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.639
Yao knows who I am now.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.560
Shouldn't we change our plan?

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.239
Yao also said Pei Yujie is
coming after us.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.640
What do we do next?

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.479
Say his name one more time
and see what happens.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.719
What do you mean?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.880
Between me and Yao...

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:22.359
Pei Yuze.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.038
How dare you do this to me
without my consent?

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:26.679
Without consent?

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:28.999
When you did this to me,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.680
did you ask for my consent?

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.279
When did I ever do that to you?

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.679
That night you had a fever.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.280
Impossible.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.758
I'd never do that.

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:38.039
Don't talk nonsense.

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:39.479
You have no proof.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.279
Fine, let me jog your memory.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.519
Did Wen Yuan find anything?

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.320
That shipment
of tungsten ore leaves tomorrow.

00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:39.119
And the company receiving it

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.358
has ties to the Japanese.

00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:41.520
The Japanese?

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.759
So, Pei Yujie is working with them.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.800
That tungsten ore must not
fall into Japanese hands.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.759
Right.

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:51.479
And we can intercept it,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.640
then use it as leverage to force
Pei Yujie to hand over the antidote.

00:08:58.639 --> 00:08:59.639
Good idea.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.800
But we'll need to be fully prepared.

00:09:04.199 --> 00:09:06.239
(Pei Residence)
The ore reached the Hu City docks

00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:07.539
this morning.

00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:09.439
We must act before the freighter
leaves before noon.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.240
Alright.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.320
Sister, a man
asked me to give you this.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.580
(I know where Lian Chen's body is. Noon,
East Suburb Warehouse, Jiang City.)

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.200
The East Suburb Warehouse.

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:23.718
It's a trap.

00:09:23.719 --> 00:09:24.759
You can't go.

00:09:25.359 --> 00:09:26.919
I know you're worried.

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:28.559
This is

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.638
the first clue in five years
about my father's body.

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:31.879
Trap or not,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.999
I have to try.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:38.559
But it's too dangerous.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.760
Don't forget, you're the one
who taught me everything.

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:43.639
I have to go.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.720
Alright.

00:09:46.359 --> 00:09:47.599
Take Jin Se with you.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.240
Check the warehouse first.

00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:51.880
Once Wen Yuan and I finish with
the tungsten, we'll meet you there.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.799
Okay.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.880
Youmeng.

00:09:59.719 --> 00:10:00.879
Be careful.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.080
(Looks like)

00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:08.278
(we must plan everything
to the last detail.)

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:09.479
Hurry up.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.960
Stay sharp.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.800
The ship is almost here.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.720
Quit stalling.

00:10:15.319 --> 00:10:16.838
Second Master, there are five men.

00:10:16.839 --> 00:10:18.399
They look tough.

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:23.719
Stop right there.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.080
Who are you?

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.280
The ones here to kill you.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.440
Get them.

00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:38.080
Miss, it's almost time.
Do we still wait?

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.400
No, we move now.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.120
Miss Du.
