=Destiny of the General's Bride=

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.020
=Episode 14=

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.280
Are the Huas moving?

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.399
No,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.320
they're pawning these.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.879
What's happened?

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.860
Last year, His Majesty
stayed at Hua Residence

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:31.540
for half a day
during his first inspection.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.439
They were rewarded with a lot of money.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:34.600
Yet they ended up

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:36.520
spending it all.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.359
It really pains my heart seeing this.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.840
Yet these are

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.159
all good stuff.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.240
Well, if anything catches your eye,
have your pick.

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:44.950
That'd spare us a trip to sell them off.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.560
Mister, we'll take all of these.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.560
Please have them delivered
to Xiao Residence.

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.159
You sure are sympathetic.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.439
Hua.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.240
We're short of money,
and now we're buying all these?

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.759
Mister.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.079
I have a question.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:04.799
I bet you saw

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.719
Empress Dowager and the Princess

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.480
during the ceremony
to greet His Majesty.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.920
My question is,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.439
do you know anything

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.680
about Empress Dowager
and the Princess' preferences?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.640
Well...

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.959
Well, I did see them.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.640
The Princess' preferences

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.439
were extraordinary.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.079
She slept on a jade bed,

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.519
and ate from a gold-inlaid bowl.

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:33.799
Even her spittoon

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.159
was made of pure gold.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.680
Other than loving gold and jade,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.359
what else does she like?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.719
Miss Qing Yan.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.599
Are you

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.599
feigning ignorance here?

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.159
Besides gold and jade,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.959
she's also into your husband.

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:02.719
That was just some trivial brat

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.159
who loved to gossip.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.990
And you buy into his words?

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.960
Yun.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.199
How much do I matter

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.439
to you?

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.319
Even a weighing scale
fails to measure that.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.919
Then how much does the Princess

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.039
matter to you?

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:46.560
Hua.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:48.759
One year ago,

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.800
to save Princess,

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.080
I was a few days late to see you.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.560
And you ended up getting hurt.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.080
You have no idea
how much I regretted that.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.319
From that day on,

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.080
nothing

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.120
matters more than you.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.919
In my heart,

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.759
there have only been two persons.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.159
One is named Qing Yan,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.280
the other Su Hua.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.960
Princess is never the one.

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.240
I'm not doubting you.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.159
But it's rare

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.639
to have someone who understands you

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:33.319
and thinks of you

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.039
in life.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.639
I know you hold me dear to your heart.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.319
However,

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.639
you don't have to always put me first.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.400
It's because

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:51.560
I couldn't

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.759
put you first.

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.319
Well, dear,

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.319
how important am I

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.840
to you?

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.639
In Su Hua's heart,

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.960
love could weigh five liang.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.920
But in Qing Yan's,

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:22.160
love could weigh only one liang.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:26.199
Yun.

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:30.839
Can you accept

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.519
a person like me?

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.180
(Xiao Residence)

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.080
These are all that's left

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.759
of Xiao Residence.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.490
But the Yingfeng Pavilion
where Empress Dowager and the Princess

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.879
will be staying in isn't ready yet.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.319
What do we do?

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.319
The princess probably
won't fancy these flashy luxuries.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.920
Even if we made use of all we have,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.639
she still might not be satisfied.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:09.360
So what now?

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:11.759
I know what to do.

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:21.000
Oh, right.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.959
Have you found someone suitable
to fix the woodshed?

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:27.360
I've got us the best craftsman
in Jiangzhou.

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:28.639
He can start anytime.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.439
Nothing can go wrong, then.

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.759
How punctual, the lady of the house.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.920
You even arrived late
to greet His Majesty.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.120
Well, you sure

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.199
are eloquent.

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:50.879
Looks like

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:52.319
you haven't learned your lesson

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:53.720
after that kick.

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:57.160
Here comes the royalty.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.920
Please make way.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.990
- Greetings, Your Majesty and Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Majesty and Your Highness.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.639
You may rise.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.990
- Thank you, Your Majesty and Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Majesty and Your Highness.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.279
(One year ago)

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:26.120
You Central Plains princess
sure are amusing.

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:28.319
Whoever marries you,

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.360
he dies.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.439
Could it be

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.120
Central Plains men

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.360
are as weak as lambs,

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:40.000
(Wujitai Khan)
and they're no match for us steppe men?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.120
So they sent you here
to curse us to death?

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.160
You greedy and cruel man.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.240
How dare you run your mouth here?

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:58.480
I am Princess Zhaoping of Great Yu,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.440
and the Chongren Khatun
who has submitted to Great Yu.

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:04.759
If you dare be rude to me today,

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:08.000
the iron cavalry of the Central Plains
will crush your skull!

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.319
Abandoned woman of Yu,

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:15.519
you still think you're a princess?

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.040
Now,

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.759
you're even less than
a mouse on the steppe.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.839
When a mouse dies,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.240
other mice feel sorry.

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:28.879
If you die,

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.879
who would pity you?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.639
I heard

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.839
those of the Central Plains

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.360
tattoo a character on the face
when they've done wrong.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.920
I just learned a new Chinese character.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.240
Tell me if I'm getting it right.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.680
Stay still! I almost got it wrong.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:16.399
I, Xiao Yun, am here
to escort Your Highness home.

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:24.879
Your steps are too high.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.279
You'll help me.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.399
What are you waiting for? Go ahead.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.440
I want him to help me.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840
I am but a nephew.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:41.970
So that would be improper.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.300
It's better to have

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.960
my wife assist in my stead.

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:49.120
Are you defying an order?

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:52.559
Please think twice, Your Highness.

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.000
Fine.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.840
I'll let it slide this time.

00:08:58.919 --> 00:08:59.759
But Xiao Yun,

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:02.279
I've thought it over.

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:05.759
The one who truly
needs to think twice is you.

00:09:17.159 --> 00:09:19.559
You were being willful just now.

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:23.600
Grandmother.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.770
I was just asking my future husband
to help me down the steps.

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:28.080
How was that willful?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.080
Girls with facial scars

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.919
always try to cover them.

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:33.159
But instead of hiding it,

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:36.639
you make it even more obvious with makeup.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.559
Grandmother, Xiao Yun said

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.080
I need not conceal my scar,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.759
nor should I find it ugly.

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:45.960
It's because it stands for

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.759
the peace I won for my people

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:50.159
by sacrificing my own marriage.

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:52.559
Xiao Yun already has a family.

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:54.120
Say it if you must,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.679
but stop dwelling on him.

00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:56.960
I was married too.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.559
Wouldn't we be a good match?

00:09:58.639 --> 00:09:59.399
Nonsense!

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:01.519
He already has a wife.

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:03.159
Grandmother,

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.240
I've looked into it.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.559
After they married,

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:08.960
they lived apart.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.679
Clearly,
there isn't much love between them.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.840
As for Xiao Yun,

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:17.559
whether he wants a divorce
or to be widowed,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.159
that's up to him.

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:24.639
What is this?

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.750
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:32.720
This garden

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:34.120
was refurbished by Qing Yan.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.720
I truly had no idea.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.639
Qing Yan?

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.919
What ill-bred thing are you?

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.159
What exactly have you planted here?

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.759
There are seasonal flowers and plants.

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:48.480
I heard Your Highness likes geraniums,

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:51.159
so I paid to have geraniums planted.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.159
I like them?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.159
It looks like you're trying to kill me!

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:56.799
I...

00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:00.840
What is this?

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:02.440
Hurry and have them removed!

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.799
Yes.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.540
- Please forgive us, Your Highness.
- Please forgive us, Your Highness.

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:08.279
My sister-in-law meant no harm.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.080
She also ordered

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.919
the finest craftsmen of Great Yu

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:13.879
to build for Your Highness

00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:15.880
a Yingfeng Pavilion
outside the residence.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.159
There's not a second like it

00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:19.440
in all of Jiangzhou.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.080
They say that pavilion

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.759
is filled with gold and jade.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.840
Why don't we go check it out?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.720
As it happens, I'd like to see it too.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.720
Let's see whether

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.679
what Qing Yan prepared pleases you.

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.000
Your Highness.

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:36.159
The Yingfeng Pavilion
is also full of geraniums.

00:11:36.846 --> 00:11:38.446
You may have to move out.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.799
That's no problem.

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:41.600
I'll order all those geraniums

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.799
to be removed.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.320
Your Highness has had a long journey,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.360
so you must be tired.

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:47.919
I am a bit tired.

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:51.279
I actually know a good place.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.279
What good place could you know?

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.000
Exactly.

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:56.720
The Yingfeng Pavilion
is the best lodging of all.

00:11:57.039 --> 00:11:59.720
My husband's garden has no geraniums.

00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:01.639
If Your Highness doesn't mind,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.900
you could stay there for now.
