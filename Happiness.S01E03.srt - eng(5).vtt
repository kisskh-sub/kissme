Otherwise, there's no reason for the soldiers to carry it around.

It's not as if they're repressing massive terror, and there are already multiple people infected.

I found out when a few of the infected tried to escape the facility.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.930
So you just lock them up here and wait for them to die?

What if you block the door and there is a fire?

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:38.360
The name of that door is "firewall." It is to prevent fires.

It keeps the fire from spreading,

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.830
but what would happen if it was kept open?

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.330
The fire would spread, wouldn't it?

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.930
It should be closed, but not blocked.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.400
If it's blocked, no one could even escape.

It was the decision of the building's firefighting administrator.

When the disease develops, the infected attacks people,

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.780
and they will try to bite at the neck. Before the symptoms surface,
[Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae Seok: If madness disease is suspected, call 1639]

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:30.890
they complain of extreme thirst.

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:35.920
If you show any symptoms or find any infected people,

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.050
please contact the Central Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:45.810
Wow, he's made it. He's on TV now.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.280
He's not talking about isolating the infected.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.070
Since Madman Rabies is shocking in itself.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:57.870
For now, they'll talk about how you can get infected, when the treatments will be out...

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.830
They'll talk about stuff like that first.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:06.300
Hey, more than that, don't go into someone else's house alone. Tell me first.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.810
I was going to.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.490
I was going to call 119 after making sure she had the Madman Rabies.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.920
But the upstairs Ahjumma...

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.110
She kept chasing after her husband.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:20.240
There's definitely something there.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.530
Pushing me inside wasn't a mistake. Never.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.040
I'll look into it and arrest him if I find anything.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.670
Okay. I feel so secure to have a detective friend.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.360
Of course.

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.380
Shall we go for a walk?

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.160
We've never gone outside together since we moved in.

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.430
Are you going out?

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:58.030
Yes. Is something wrong?

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.480
I wanted to ask you to keep quiet about what happened today.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.290
Don't post about it anywhere, and don't spread any rumors.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:11.080
But so many people saw what happened. How could we...

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.380
They all live in our apartment building.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.530
It's difficult for outsiders to come in here.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:19.510
We just have to keep quiet, unite and not make a big deal out of it.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.840
Will it then really not become a big deal?

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:27.320
Bad rumors are bad for real estate prices.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.280
Are you worried about real estate prices amid all this?

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:34.980
You'll live here for at least ten years anyway.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.290
Wouldn't it benefit both of you

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:40.310
to say you live in a high-priced apartment?

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.170
The apartment representation Ahjumma is right.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:41:00.830
It's crazy out there, yet it's so peaceful here.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:05.460
Living here, the real estate price and happiness...

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.630
I think she would want to revel in it.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:10.940
Even if she has to hide facts about the infected, if necessary.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:04.480
You totally screwed me over this afternoon.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.980
Did they send you home?

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.800
They said my tests came out so clean that I should just quarantine at home.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.720
So even if it gets noisy at night, be understanding.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.970
You'll get to isolate yourself in jail soon. Don't worry.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:18.670
Jail?

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:21.280
After my quarantine is over, I'll just...

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.750
I'll report you first!

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:24.390
You messed with the wrong person!

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:29.320
When it comes to reporting and suing people, I'm an expert at it. I'm the best.

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.270
This was found in the infected person's house.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:54.910
It looks like you took care of the dealers at the car wash.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:58.870
Taking that drug gives you Madman Rabies, right?

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:07.150
I'm sure you didn't come all the way here to ask me that, did you?

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:11.320
Park Min Ji is here, right?

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.260
I would like to meet her right now.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.660
Watch out.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.440
Park Min Ji.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:42.380
Shouldn't she be back to being herself?

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:47.340
She should be dead by now.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:51.870
The disease surfaced right before she was about to die. She's alive now because of the virus.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:54.630
So if she's back to herself...

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.050
She'll probably die.

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:59.240
She's all messed up in her head.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.970
She must know it herself. She's been like that all this time.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:05.680
It could be because she feels injustice.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.020
Perhaps she wants to tell who killed her.

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:13.640
Park Min Ji.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.290
Don't worry.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:21.460
I will definitely catch whoever did this to you.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.350
It's late, isn't it?

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:15.780
I had a lot to take care of.

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:19.690
Where is this?

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:24.060
According to your description, it is where we lock up guard dogs.

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:27.490
Your friends are behind you. Be careful so you don't wake them up.

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:33.350
An ordinary woman living in an ordinary apartment

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:38.480
developed the disease, and we found this at her house.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.660
Seyang Forest, Le Ciel.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:44.270
You sold it to her, right?

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:50.920
If I tell you, will you let me go?

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:54.010
Why do you think you're in here?

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:09.090
If... If you promise to save me, I'll tell you everything.

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:17.870
If there's something you desperately want, you won't give in to your thirst.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:23.320
So think about...

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:28.670
what you really want.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.820
Aren't you going to make dinner?

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.360
How much longer will you be lying down?

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:47.230
Maybe I was in shock yesterday. I'm feeling weak.

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:51.050
Aigoo, look at you. What a weakling you are.

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:52.600
I'll eat dinner out!

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.590
Honey, I want to eat a hamburger.

00:46:56.590 --> 00:47:00.680
You should eat rice! Is bread the same thing? Aigoo...

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:13.680
Hello?

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.190
Park Min Ji just passed away.

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.840
In the end, she didn't attack people.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.150
She was just spaced out.

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:25.470
Thanks for letting me know.

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.980
Here is the report from the NFS.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:43.860
Let's go.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.030
Right now? Will that be okay?

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.650
That's not a sure deal yet.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.080
Let's go. We have to help out someone.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.790
Hey! Be careful!

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:54.280
Hey, if you don't arrest him with that, it'll be a problem.

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.910
Police, excuse me.

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:02.790
Why are you barging in here?

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:06.800
How could both of you and your wife be so rude?

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:16.110
Park Min Ji passed away.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.770
She...

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.750
All she did was struggle.

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.300
What, what?

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:44.350
You already cleaned up everything in that time.

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:48.320
I don't like the smell of the blood, and I was worried that the germs would be left behind so I cleaned up.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.150
Why?

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:03.610
So did you clean up your golf clubs too?

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:07.250
Your wife's head was pretty much crushed.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.310
The area you beat her with a golf club.

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:15.930
It was self-defense. She was trying to bite me. What else could I do?

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:20.090
If only it wasn't Madman Rabies, things would have turned out the way you wanted, right?

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:25.010
- What?
- She should've died when you hit her with your golf club.

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:28.620
But Park Min Ji suddenly developed the disease and didn't die.

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:32.550
If it weren't for that, you could've disposed of the body

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:34.820
and could've committed a perfect crime.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:39.500
Perfect crime? What the hell are you talking about?

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:43.050
This is the NFS report on the blood found on that golf club.

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:46.550
A strong impact from an adult male's strike with all his strength.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:48.610
Fragments of the laryngeal bone and cerebral tissues were discovered.

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:51.820
It looks as though the perpetrator struck the weapon intending to murder her.

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.480
I told you.

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.910
I got scared. Her eyes turned white, and she attacked me trying to bite me.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.970
If it were you, would you die

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:00.870
by being bitten by your wife?

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:02.770
Do you love your wife that much?

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:05.630
So I looked into your trial records.

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:07.420
You had quite a record.

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:12.510
Illegal medical procedures, revocation of your license, and even declaring bankruptcy.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.670
You handed over that dermatology clinic to your wife.

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:21.100
You must've thought you could get back on your feet if your wife weren't around.

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:24.720
So? So what? What? What? What about it?

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:28.630
Numerous people saw my wife walking around perfectly fine.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:31.400
How will you prove that...

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:36.230
How will you prove that I killed my wife?

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:39.430
I have a witness.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.650
Sang Hee.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.880
Oh Joo Hyung, you're under arrest for the suspicion of killing your wife Park Min Ji.

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:20.910
Honey.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.870
We'll stop everyone as planned.

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:53.490
- Sir.
- More people will get hurt if we delay it.

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:26.300
Well...

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:33.510
Geez...

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:45.310
I decided to get the surgery.

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.020
Did you decide?

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:53.980
My mom is extremely worried, but it's also worrisome if the disease is spread in the apartment.

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:57.270
My wounds don't heal well.

00:52:57.270 --> 00:53:00.150
I take antibiotics too.

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:04.470
I asked to leave quietly while all this was going on and get the surgery.

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:05.930
When do you leave?

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:09.810
I will go for an exam when my mom comes home later.

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:14.350
It's that ahjussi who was on TV.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.510
Is he your friend, Unni?

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:21.000
No. I just know him.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.520
What brings you here?

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:27.000
Madman Rabies is spreading throughout the apartment building.

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:34.350
One person already caught it.

00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:36.450
Are there more infected people?

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:42.140
I questioned a drug dealer, and he says he sold the drug at the underground gym.

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:46.130
He sold them saying it helps you focus and for dieting.

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:51.090
Park Min Ji from the sixth floor was one of the buyers.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:54.060
- Hello, Ma'am.
- Hello.

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:17.410
Hello.

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:19.170
Aigoo, Ma'am. You're here.

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.950
- How have you been?
- Good.

00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:23.610
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:26.080
Thank you. Enjoy your workout.

[Le Ciel Fitness & Gym]
[Beom | Heon | Hong]

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:33.330
There must be quite a few people like Park Min Ji inside the apartment.

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:38.490
I'm sure some people are living quietly, hiding the signs of their illness.

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:43.370
The numbers of infected will increase quietly like that and explode all at once.

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:47.560
What are you doing here then? You should start the investigation.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.470
Will that solve the issue? When we don't have any treatment or vaccine?

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:56.520
We don't know when the apartment residents will start having symptoms. Where should we keep them and monitor them?

00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:00.860
It's not like we can slaughter all of them like the swine flu.

00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:03.390
What will you do then?

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:06.710
Do you have another way?

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:11.350
I do have another way.

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.740
[Exit]

00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:54.830
What is happening?

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:57.540
Why are you trapping us in?

00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:59.470
What is this for?

00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:05.240
Come on!

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:27.160
As luck would have it, only residents are allowed to use the gym.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:29.220
And half of the residents are families,

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:33.610
and the daycare inside the apartment hasn't opened yet.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.350
Will you block off the entire apartment building?

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:42.310
Until we obtain the workforce and location to monitor all the infected.

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:47.730
You should notify the apartment's residents so people can mentally prepare.

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:53.260
They won't mentally prepare but run away and spread the disease.

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.190
You can get out, Yoon Sae Bom.

00:56:56.190 --> 00:57:01.040
When it comes to work of this nature, we are always in need of decisive people.

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.680
It's my fault.

00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:18.440
When I found out what you were doing at the dorm, I should've released everything to the newspapers, news, everywhere.

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.330
That wouldn't have changed anything.

00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:25.050
You have to prioritize things when it comes to dealing with these situations.

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:30.230
Who is a more essential person and what is more needed...

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:33.050
I guess I'm an essential person.

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:47.410
However, I decided to live here, and this is my home.

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:50.450
Whether it's noise problems or Madman Rabies,

00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:55.260
running away isn't my style.

00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:58.300
Good day.

00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:12.640
Hey, I'm in front of your house.

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:16.820
Hey, I came all the way here. How can I go back?

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:18.550
Yes.

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.300
What the heck?

00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:37.230
This is my apartment building. Is something wrong?

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:38.840
If you go inside now, you can't get out again.

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.950
What? What is he talking about?

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:44.970
Yes. What floor are you on?

00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:46.940
I'm coming in right now.

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:09.950
Hyun, I'm trapped inside.

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:12.550
Don't get into a fight trying to come in.

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:15.760
If my mom calls you, tell her I'm okay.

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:19.910
What are you talking about? Where are you trapped?

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:23.560
I'll protect the apartment.

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:27.470
Wait, Bom, tell me exactly what's going on. What's...

00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:35.440
I mean, I was going to tell you when I knew for sure...

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.440
I thought I was in here alone.

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:58.980
Sae Bom, I have to catch him right now.

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.680
It's okay. No one can get out.

01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:41.880
[Happiness]

~ Preview ~
Let me leave.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.870
You two could likely be infectious.
[Mom: Seo Yoon, I love you]

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:05.090
You don't know how things have changed on the outside.

01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:07.710
Did you take that drug, too?

01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:09.470
You know who took them, right?

01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:12.960
No one knows how drastically people would change when push comes to shove.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.410
What are you doing right now?

01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:18.350
They say we can't leave now. Other apartment buildings voted and decided that.

01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:20.510
Yoon Sae Bom, are you safe?

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.730
It's blood.

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:24.220
Hurry and come out if you don't want to die!

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.220
Help me, please!

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:28.680
It will be all over in seventy-two hours.
