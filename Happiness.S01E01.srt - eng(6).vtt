- To speak from down here.

Then give him a megaphone, too. Damn it.

Teacher, why are we still here when the class is over? It's impossible to create a study atmosphere anyway.

If you all go running out, would Yi Hyun be happy?

I'm sure you have a great study atmosphere at home!

Yes, I'll let you go right away.

Hey, I'll take the responsibility and help you fully recover!

If I can't, I'll help you become a cop or something so trust me and let's go down.

I am his friend. They told me to come up since I'll be helpful to the negotiation.

No. Hey, we can't go home because of you.

Are you struggling since you can't play baseball?

It's not like that.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.150
I just came up because I felt frustrated, but the ambulance and the police car drove onto the field all of a sudden.

Which jerk reported me?

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.660
I'm just watching to see how far they'll go. I have nothing else to do anyway.

You have nothing else to do besides baseball?

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.790
Of course not. That's all I did all my life. And I was pretty good at it.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.520
And this happened to me. Would you be okay if you were me?

I never did anything in my life, and I've been fine.

I wanted to become a nurse until last week, but I'm considering becoming a civil servant now.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.330

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:40.810
Both of his eyes were cloudy, as if he had cataracts.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:44.190
He tried to bite off a part of me as if he was a beast.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:48.760
I shot him twice, but it didn't look like he felt any pain at all.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:53.630
Is this like rabies?

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:56.350
It's similar.

My detective friend said he could be drugged.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:04.310
If someone went crazy and tore off the flesh from a person, the police would believe it's from drugs.

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:06.440
but water doesn't satisfy.

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:17.580
When the person is back to normal, he gets thirsty again and is irrational again.

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.700
We're trying to find out the condition that gets him thirsty.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:24.530
I was curious to find out how Lee Jong Tae would behave after seeing you.

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:28.030
You wanted to know how he would feel if he saw the person who shot him?

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:32.790
He recognizes his family. I wondered how he would be with others.

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:35.850
That wasn't all.

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:40.220
His heartbeat is slower, and he seems to feel less pain too.

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:43.150
And his wounds heal quickly.

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:46.790
It would help us a lot as long as we can control it.

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:53.560
Is that why you're investigating this in secret?

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:56.830
It's not highly infectious, but it will scare people.

00:52:56.830 --> 00:53:01.620
We need to study its infectious nature. There's no need to make this matter bigger than it is.

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:12.340
But why do you have the AC on?

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:15.880
The onset of the disease is slowed down in low temperatures.

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:26.030
Is this a test, too? To find out if I get thirsty or not?

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:29.080
The test results show that you're fine. Really.

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:34.290
I'm not usually that lucky of a person.

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:36.550
Why don't you take a break for a while?

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.430
Here?

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:41.170
Wherever you'd like.

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:46.060
Really? Is that possible?

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:51.680
We can just say you achieved great things for your country, but you're wounded physically and emotionally.

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.920
And we'll have to draw your blood every two weeks.

00:53:54.920 --> 00:54:00.780
I don't see that you're displaying any symptoms. You could've developed antibodies.

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:05.670
[Temporary Access]

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:13.510
I get the feeling that I'm pretty important.

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.650
One more thing.

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.480
You said I achieved something great.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.850
Then please raise my service evaluation score to the highest possible for this year.

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:28.150
Pardon?

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:33.250
The public rental apartment in Seyang City. The special options for police. They're selecting tenants based on our scores.

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:38.620
For newlyweds, based on dependants, years of service, and service evaluation. Everything combined.

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.590
You have that much influence, right?

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:47.250
That should be possible.

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:50.010
Since your evaluation looks pretty good.

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:54.770
Of course, since I have the best evaluation. I was born to suppress terrorism.

00:54:56.470 --> 00:55:00.540
Lieutenant Colonel, I'm glad we're on the same page.

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.270
People don't shake hands these days.

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:06.470
My cell phone.

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:14.730
I guess you don't serve breakfast here? How cold-hearted.

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:25.530
Thank you. I'll take it home and savor it.

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:31.270
Do you have a boyfriend?

00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:41.620
It's not that I don't like you, Lieutenant Colonel, but our age difference is too much.

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:43.660
Your score won't be enough even with the service evaluation score.

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:46.970
You'll need more points. I was wondering if you had any plans.

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:50.250
Plans? I'll have to start making one now.

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.850
Aren't you worried?

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:57.120
I'll make sure I get an apartment unit so no need to worry about me.

00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.130
I meant about what you saw in the past two days.

00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:05.640
If things go wrong, the world as you know it could change.

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.420
Does worrying change anything?

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:11.670
It may not change.

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:29.050
First Lieutenant, where are the clothes I wore here?

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:32.290
I incinerated them.

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:36.360
Do I go home in this then?

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:39.620
Yoon Sae Bom?

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:43.270
Hey! Are you okay? Let me see you.

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:51.350
First Lieutenant, you still don't trust me!

00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:54.350
I'm really disappointed.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:56.580
They said I'm fine. I can go home.

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.420
Sorry. It's my fault.

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.490
Your face looks thinner.

00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:06.870
Really? It's because I haven't had breakfast.

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.750
How did you get in here?

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:11.490
Did they arrest you, too? Did you get bitten?

00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:14.890
No, I'm here to rescue you.

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:19.380
Wait here for a minute. I'll be right back.

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.870
Punk...

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:43.180
You look like you might be able to play baseball again.

00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:51.110
Is this that drug?

00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:55.460
Yes, I heard it's a failed drug for pneumonia.

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:58.390
And tons of people have taken that.

00:57:58.390 --> 00:58:03.010
I heard people didn't go mad because of the drug, but I brought it to you since I promised you I would.

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:08.640
Just because she was okay yesterday doesn't mean she'll be okay today.

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:16.290
I'm off.

00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:53.110
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:57.270
Right. You were so near.

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.130
Hyun.

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.710
Are you dating anyone?

00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:06.970
What are you suddenly talking about?

00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:08.560
- Are you dating anyone?
- No one.

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.680
Do you snore? Or grind your teeth?

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:11.840
Probably not.

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.050
Should we get married?

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:19.870
Jung Yi Hyun, tell him you don't want to press charges.

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:20.960
He is arresting me.

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.880
Hey, Yoon Sae Bom.

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:27.270
Do you want to date me?

00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:33.170
- No.
- Wow...

00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:39.390
I clearly told you then that I was just joking.

00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:41.910
I'm not joking, though.

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:43.870
For real.

When people go crazy like that all of a sudden...

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:31.530
The background check on Han Tae Seok that you asked for.

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:33.360
I really hate that guy.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.480
I got a place of my own.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:40.880
It doesn't open. From here, the lower floors are for rent, and the upper floors are for general sale.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.170
I got a call from reporter Ki Joo.

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:45.580
There's a way where my safety is guaranteed, and I can make some money.

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.830
Hey, Lee Seung Hyun!

01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:48.290
There's a problem at the dorm.

01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:51.040
Where are severely ill patients?

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.350
They're still alive. They're human.

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.870
More people will get hurt if we're late.
