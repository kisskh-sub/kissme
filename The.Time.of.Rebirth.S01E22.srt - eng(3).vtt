00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.640
Brother Lin has been inside the formation array for a while.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.200
I wonder how he's progressing.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.319
Palace Master.

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:17.280
The Demon Emperor of Seven Tribulations has returned.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.400
He has announced to the world

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:20.159
that in three days, he will wipe out the Sect of Forgotten Immortals.

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:25.640
Sis, something's wrong!

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.640
Many sect disciples have defected.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:29.560
I already know.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.680
Those cowards who fear death,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.480
have wasted all the kindness our sect gave them.

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:34.680
Sect Leader.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.239
Lin Yue, he...

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.840
Be patient.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.439
Let fate decide.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.959
where our sect will end up.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.000
Big.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.519
You lost again.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.159
Ribs.

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:52.959
Only a third of your bones are broken.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.840
Your soul is already very weak.

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.400
If you give up now,

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.439
you might still have a chance to survive.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.439
Continue.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.599
Let me handle this round.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.319
Bet big or small?

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.240
Since you always bet big,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.360
I'll bet small.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.439
Leopard wins all.

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.840
How do we count that?

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.879
If it's a win-all,

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.000
it's up to you.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:36.719
Then everything that's left

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.960
all of it.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.439
As you wish.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.439
After all these years, I finally

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.840
got my hands on such a talented fool.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.520
You are the perfect vessel for my power.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.919
How could I not possess your body?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.719
I will use your body

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.439
to live another lifetime.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.000
Sect of Forgotten Immortals.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.439
Yiyi.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.759
They're here.

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:34.800
Mountain Protection Array.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.080
Empowered by generations of Sect Leaders.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.759
Even the Demon Emperor of Seven Tribulations

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.000
can't break through so easily.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.280
How could this happen?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.599
Our sect's thousand-year foundation

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.479
is so fragile before the Demon Emperor.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.159
Is it really this weak?

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:03.199
Everyone,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.319
today we live or die with our sect.

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.639
Submit to me

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.879
and you may live.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.759
Keep dreaming.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.759
We stayed here today

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.040
knowing we wouldn't survive.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.079
Qinji, as Sect Leader,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.079
will you ignore your people's lives?

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.040
What a joke.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:24.439
We of the Sect of Forgotten Immortals

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:26.199
are not cowards who fear death.

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:30.240
When the Immortal Founder established our sect,

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.600
he created the Sect of Forgotten Immortals.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:35.920
He taught us to cultivate fate and pursue the eternal Dao.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.720
But even he couldn't see through the Dao.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.600
How could he know if his path was right?

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.720
Isn't that a joke?

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.480
Your Majesty, Demon Emperor.

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.079
I, your old servant Xuanyou,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.240
wish to follow you,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.959
and seek the true Dao.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.199
Futile.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.439
Sect Leader.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.439
Now's the time!

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.560
Ten Thousand Curses Binding Array!

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.279
Sword Maniac, Longlin!

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.040
Destroy everything!

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.680
Heavenly Sword Array of Demon-Slaying!

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:04.959
It actually worked!

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.800
Sect Leader.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.920
What are you doing?

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.959
Why is everyone fighting each other?

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.040
Illusions and deceptions.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.000
Lost in appearances.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.759
Can't even see through such simple illusions.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:21.000
Your cultivation is far too weak.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.319
Sect Leader.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.560
Admit your fear.

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.240
Submit and serve me.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.319
I'm not afraid of you.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.000
Even if I vanish in the next moment,

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:35.199
I'm still not afraid of you.

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:38.920
Then disappear now.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.839
Who is it?

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:01.240
My woman

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:03.439
Is she someone you can boss around?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.600
You came to break through the array

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.839
to kill the Seven Evils Demon Emperor

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:08.680
What else would it be?

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:10.079
Why do you have to kill him?

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.480
Why does it have to be you?

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:14.439
You, you, you—

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.839
You’re really messing with my head!

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.480
You’re dead set on killing Seven Evils, aren’t you?

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:22.759
I’m almost gone myself

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:23.959
Why would I lie to you now?

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.160
Forget it, I won’t dwell on it

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:29.439
I’ll return your body to you

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.920
And give you my legacy

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.040
Senior

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.480
What are you up to now?

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.399
Why do you care what I’m up to?

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:36.079
Just do one thing for me

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:38.319
Kill that old bastard Seven Evils

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:40.839
You’re really lucky, you know that?

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.360
There’s one more thing

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.519
You want to ask me

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.360
why I don’t finish the soul possession

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.800
and take revenge myself, right?

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.360
After soul possession

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.319
I’d be left with barely a tenth of my power

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:53.040
Even if I made it back to reality

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.319
I’d only be able to scrape by

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.879
But if I give you my legacy

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.240
you can kill him for me

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.600
that old bastard Seven Evils

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.879
Karma’s a bitch

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.519
Senior

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.959
Any last words?

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.720
When you see Seven Evils

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.959
Beat him to death for me

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:14.120
Beat him to a pulp

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:15.920
Utter annihilation

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.439
Got it?

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:31.800
Lin Yue

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:36.399
Sorry, I’m late

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:39.039
I told you

00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:40.240
I’d come back

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:42.720
I know

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:55.200
Interesting

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:58.279
You’re worthy of my attention

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:01.480
You all take a break

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:03.519
I’ll go beat him up again

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:04.200
Lin Yue

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.919
Don’t hold back

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.200
Beat him to death

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.639
Alright

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:13.399
Mo Dragon Emperor

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.200
Brahma Fruit

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.960
Looks like you’ve gathered everything I wanted

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:19.879
Of course

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.440
Or how else would I kill you?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.440
You’re lucky to have made it this far

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.759
If you’re willing to serve me

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.360
I can give you a chance

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.600
For a hundred millennia

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:32.679
You’ve killed me countless times

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.440
This time, it’s your turn to die
