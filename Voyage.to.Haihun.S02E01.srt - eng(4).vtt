=Voyage to Haihun, Season 2=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.260
=Episode 1=

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.600
(Where am I?)

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.790
(Looks like I messed up this round.)

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.380
(Let me restart then.)

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.690
How long has it been?

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.590
Two days.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.460
Our men from Changyi will still die.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.330
And so will you.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.510
So, why not risk it all?

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.710
Heng.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.630
What on earth happened?

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.170
- Wait for me to wake up.
- Wang Heng.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.220
Heng.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.040
Don't forget.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.960
You're the uncertain fate
I've been waiting for.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.190
(Right, Liu He is still waiting
for me to save him.)

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.040
(I can't die.)

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.220
Heng.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.310
Help me.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.180
De Jiu.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.550
De Jiu.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.460
Heng, you're awake.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.740
De Jiu.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.460
Don't worry.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.210
Lady De Jiu isn't in danger for now.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.040
Heng.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.940
Why is it you two?

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.290
What happened in Wucheng Village?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.660
A troop from the Western Regions
suddenly arrived.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.360
I didn't get a clear look at them,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.680
and you and De Jiu

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.080
were trapped in deadly peril.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.580
I could only take you
through the secret tunnel.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.750
What about our men from Changyi?

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.820
What about them?

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.090
As for what happened later,

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.830
I have no idea.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.280
What time is it now?

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.380
What time is it?

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.520
Heng.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.960
Heng.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.340
You're gravely wounded.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.420
Going now will do no good.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.780
Besides, Liu He...

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.180
Liu He has been deposed.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.820
Heng.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.230
All those careful plans...

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.340
Still, man's plans can't match Heaven's.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.430
Kang, I'll repay
this life-saving grace someday.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.380
My bond with Liu He remains.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.870
I must see him.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.410
Lady Xu.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.450
Look after De Jiu for me.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.340
Heng.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.080
Hyah!

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.260
Hyah!

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.540
Indecision

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.820
leads to chaos.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.080
Indecision

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.300
leads to chaos.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.420
Indecision...

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.260
Hyah!

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.540
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.400
Whoa.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.300
Whoa.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.500
Lord Wang.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.860
Is the Duke of Changyi still here?

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.700
He went to Wucheng Village to find you.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.630
Hyah!

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.300
Hyah!

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.500
Quick, run!

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.860
Run!

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.000
Hyah!

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.560
He deposed me just to make it easier
to kill me, right?

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.670
Come on!

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.310
I have never known fear.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.950
Hyah!

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.180
(Still, I'm too late.)

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.260
Liu He,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.780
I'll save you

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.460
once more.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:12.060
(14th day of the 8th month, 74 BC)

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.060
Heng, you're awake!

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.350
Heng!

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.290
Heng!

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.220
Lady Xu.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:21.740
Please take care of De Jiu.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.100
Kang, find Lord Xu for me.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.120
Have him bring men
to rescue Wucheng Village.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.070
Heng!

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.140
(I must make it in time.)

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.180
(This time, I must make it in time.)

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.330
(Liu He.)

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.280
(Hold on.)

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.780
Over there.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.660
Heng.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.950
Hurry, save him.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.820
Heng.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.590
- Quick.
- Heng.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.220
You're finally awake.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.860
Here.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.980
Let me help you up.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.060
Qingge.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.490
Where are we heading?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.820
We're on the road back to Changyi.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.260
Changyi?

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.420
Yeah.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.720
But I went to Wucheng Village.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.570
When I reached Wucheng Village,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.840
Lord Xu had saved you.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.180
Lord Xu...

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.470
You must be looking for this.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.940
When you were unconscious,
you held it tight in your hand.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.180
What about them?

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.350
Are they with us?

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.820
Tell me.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.900
Where are they now?

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.760
Tell me.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:09.980
Where are they?

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:13.860
It's all my fault.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.060
If I had sent a warning sooner,

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.580
this tragedy wouldn't have happened.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.660
It's all on me.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.060
They're all gone?

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:34.780
Tell me.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.160
All of them are gone?

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.560
How could that be?

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.290
How could they all be gone?

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.000
It's my fault.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.340
I was the one who sent them to ruin.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.460
I will join them.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.160
I will join them.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.740
Liu He, Liu He...

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.810
They're already gone.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.470
What's the point in doing this now?

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.340
It's alright. I'm still here.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.020
I'll stay by your side.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.780
I'll be here with you.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.250
But they're all gone.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.460
They're all gone.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.150
It's all because of me.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.330
Ah!

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:08.780
(Changyi)

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.100
You can't even ride.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.780
How are you different from the useless?

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.920
You fool.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.720
Who says one must ride to manage horses?

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.000
Don't you want to see the Duke?

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.920
The first "Changyi Riders"

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.940
"Racing with the Wind".

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.860
The finals begin now!

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.840
Go for it!

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.780
Ride faster later.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:40.620
(Changyi)

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:51.980
Wang Heng.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.480
You're the last one.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.090
My apologies.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.910
I drank too much alone last night.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.120
It cost me some time.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.390
Liu He.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.420
Yes?

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.580
(Qingge Tavern)

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.420
This is the ad space I've prepared

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.040
for our esteemed patrons.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.730
All prime spots for display.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.020
Take a look here.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.460
The horse's neck, the horse's belly,

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.420
and the most expensive spot here,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.130
which is called the Flattery Seat.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.210
What brings you all here?

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.360
Heng.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:00.790
Bushi.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.670
- Li Qi.
- Duke.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.200
Liu He.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.480
Liu He.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.290
Liu He.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.750
Let's go.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.980
(Duke of Guangling's Mansion)

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:43.810
Du.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.610
Du, what's wrong?

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:47.830
It's nothing.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.680
Since Liu He has been dethroned,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.750
leaving him to linger on

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:53.700
matters little.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.420
I am now the sole heir to the throne.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.460
This is Heaven's will.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.130
Since the remnants of Changyi

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.300
no longer serve any use,

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.080
why not wipe them all out

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.410
to prevent future troubles?

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.340
We'll do as you say.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.740
Bring them in.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.100
Du.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.090
He's going to kill us.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.340
What are you doing?

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.460
Out. Move.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.860
What are you doing?

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.210
- Move.
- Where are you taking me?

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.440
Take them away.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.620
Move.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.500
On your knees.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.220
Your Highness, they're here.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:36.150
Kill them.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.200
Spare me! I have things to report.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.100
I can ensure that you live a long life.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.400
Well.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.190
You lowly commoner.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.600
How could you manage that?

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.010
Duke.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.530
I know Liu He has a sacred item.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:05.770
It's the Qilin.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.020
It can grant you a long life.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.360
A long and healthy life.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.200
Oh?

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.290
Explain in detail.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.610
Just say the spell,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.510
and the Qilin
will glow from head to toe.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.070
Any wish can then come true.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.480
Does such a thing really exist?

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.840
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.420
Where is the Qilin now?

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.890
Before reaching Chang'an,

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.320
it was seized by Huo Guang.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.580
Interesting.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.700
Is what you said

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.940
all true?

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:44.830
Every word is true.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.050
Only Liu He knows the spell.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.080
I am his confidant.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.730
I can help you get the spell.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.000
Li Nvxu.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.300
Yes.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.670
Set out for Chang'an at once.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.940
I will soon ascend the throne.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.950
Make the necessary arrangements

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.350
and lobby when needed in Chang'an.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.190
While you're at it,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.020
see if the Qilin is with Huo Guang.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:06.570
Yes.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.140
(Three years later, in 71 BC,)

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:14.785
(Xu became)

00:15:14.786 --> 00:15:15.430
(the Empress.)

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:15.855
(Huo Xian)

00:15:15.856 --> 00:15:16.370
(killed Xu,)

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.165
(and Huo Chengjun)

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:17.750
(entered)

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.730
(the Palace,)

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.900
(leading to the downfall.)

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.340
Liu He.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.280
That makes it the 351st time.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.090
San.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:15.630
San.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:18.870
San.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:25.870
Do I look like her?

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.410
I'm talking to you.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.510
(It's been three years.)

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.800
(Every remedy has been tried,
yet he's still in a coma.)

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.700
Are you the one closest to him?

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.580
Are you?

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.630
I suppose so.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.550
Good.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.800
The gloom has long settled in his heart.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.940
Only if one dear to him
offers love and care

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.680
can the illness be cured.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.490
Breath meeting breath

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.340
is a fine remedy to awaken the spirit.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.870
With a gentle touch of your lips,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.330
warmth will pour
into the deepest valley,

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.720
reaching the hidden chambers
of the soul,

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.160
clearing the mind's haze,

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.110
and stirring tender yearning within.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.310
Utter nonsense.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.360
