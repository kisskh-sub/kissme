[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.950
[Episode 20]

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.240
A broken sword can be reforged.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.310
A withered flower will bloom again.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.860
Even if the body is destroyed,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.860
it's just a new beginning.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.960
A broken sword can be reforged.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
A withered flower will bloom again.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.100
Son, remember this:

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.240
even if you're shattered to pieces,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.240
it's merely a chance to start anew.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.530
To learn and practice constantly,

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.790
is that not a pleasure?

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.520
To have friends come from afar,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.720
is that not a delight?

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.240
To stay unbothered when misunderstood,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.430
isn't that noble?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.280
Applause.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.520
Qiushui.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.320
From today onwards,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.590
your brother will teach you
the Huanhua Sword Technique for me.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.440
You must study hard.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.150
Xilou,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.590
do you think Qiushui
has a talent for martial arts?

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.140
He's my son after all.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.829
He'll be just like Yiren someday.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.280
Qiushui,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.410
take a break.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.980
I made your favorite noodles.
Come quickly.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.750
Mother.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.680
Let me wipe your sweat. Come on.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.000
Come on, eat up.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.310
Be careful. It's hot.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.910
No one's fighting you for it.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.990
Mother, it's delicious.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.780
If you like it, have some more.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:12.400
Well,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.290
want me to roll the noodles
into a drumstick for you?

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.240
Let me roll a noodle drumstick for you.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.920
A big one.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.300
Open your mouth. Here.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.070
Good boy!

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.720
Eat the egg too.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.830
Okay.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.270
Qiushui.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.270
Take a break.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.600
Qiushui,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.680
a sword is a gentleman's weapon.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.600
Swordsmanship isn't just about techniques.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.530
You must put your heart into it.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.400
Remember,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.830
the sword in your hand

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.920
represents our Xiao family.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.750
No matter where you go in the future,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.520
you must make the Huanhua Sword Technique
renowned throughout the world.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.810
Do you understand?

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.730
I'll keep it in mind.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.000
Ancestors above,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.040
Xiao Kaiyan, Xiao Yiren,
Xiao Qiushui, and Xiao Xueyu

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.170
make this vow today.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.810
We'll carry on
our parents' lofty ambitions,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.040
wield our swords
for justice in the martial world,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.480
keep our family
and the country in our hearts,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.140
and fail neither ourselves
nor the ones we love.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.630
I remember now.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.000
I remember now.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.770
Father,

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.920
Mother,

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.950
Yiren,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.830
Kaiyan,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.830
and Xueyu.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.310
I remember now.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.630
I finally remember.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.340
Wonderful.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.420
With the Changge Sword's return,

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.720
the Huanhua Sect is reborn.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.630
Xiao Qiushui.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.330
You are now the new sect leader
of the Huanhua Sect.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.750
Only you

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.720
have recovered,
one by one, all the broken swords

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.580
of the Huanhua Sect's disciples.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.190
This is the true meaning
of reforging broken swords.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.950
I, Xiao Qiushui,

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.470
will not fail the trust of my ancestors.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.450
Don't worry, Qiushui.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.350
I'll continue to help you

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.860
find a way to restore your meridians.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.050
Your Highness,

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.160
I have no way

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.640
to repay your kindness.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.170
Qiushui.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.700
[Tang Sect]

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.070
Father,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.390
I'm back.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.600
Fang is back.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.420
I'm glad you've returned safely.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.040
Father,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.159
I've come back this time
to ask for your help with something.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.950
What is it? Tell me.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.930
If someone's meridians

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.150
were shattered

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.630
by Qu Hanshan's palm strike

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.000
and then further twisted

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.720
by the clash of the purest yin

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.720
and yang internal energies in the world,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.120
do you think there's a cure for him?

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:36.150
The only one who can save Xiao Qiushui now

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.320
is Grand Master Dayin.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.360
Father, how do you know
I'm talking about him?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.950
Prince Liang has been

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.790
sending out notices seeking medical help.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.850
Everyone in the martial world
knows about it,

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.910
let alone me.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.030
But

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.180
why do you want to save him?

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.720
He's my friend,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.800
and he was Tang Rou's closest friend
when he was alive.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.200
My dear Fang,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.440
I know what you're thinking.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.630
But

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.840
do you know who injured him so badly?

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.120
Liu Suifeng.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.330
As the eldest son
of the Tang Sect's main branch,

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.550
he has now become
the Deputy Chief of the Power Gang

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.510
and a menace to the martial world.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.080
Father,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.680
you already knew?

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.330
Then why didn't you

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.610
keep Feng in the main branch back then?

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.960
He could have grown up

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.800
in the Tang Sect just like me.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.360
Back then, I wanted
to protect him and his mother.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.600
But you know the rules of the Tang Sect.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:14.550
Marriage with outsiders
is strictly forbidden.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.670
Back then,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.360
to make our family
the main branch of the Tang Sect,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.750
I had no choice

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.710
but to cut ties with them.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.510
Now the Tang Sect's Yinhai Night
is approaching.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.790
I never expected

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.630
you'd face the same dilemma I once did.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.170
Is being the main branch

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.140
really that important?

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.380
If we weren't the main branch,

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.200
Old Madam Tang would've forced you

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.730
to marry Tang Song long ago.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.030
Fang,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.480
you now understand what's at stake.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.640
As for your friend Xiao Qiushui,

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.670
whether you continue
your association with him

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.150
is your decision to make.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.980
I understand, Father.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.000
But I must save Xiao Qiushui.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.150
Fine.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.030
Grand Master Dayin

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.890
lives in the nearby Biechuan Temple.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.960
Tell your friend to seek him out.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.280
Thank you, Father.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.380
I won't sneak out
without permission this time.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.450
I'll just send the message
to Prince Liang's quarters.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:41.480
Okay.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.750
Go now.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.490
Everything in this world is real.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.030
Xiao Mingming and Xiao Qiushui
both truly exist.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.680
I, Xiao Mingming, am Xiao Qiushui
of the Huanhua Sect.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.350
Could it be the Magic Code System

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.960
that caused the timelines
of two worlds to intersect,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.910
giving us shared memories?

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.270
In that world's system,

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.510
I placed the "Voidheart Codex"
in the Sword Tomb.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.840
Could it be...

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.270
Strange.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.240
Why are

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.480
all the words here crossed out?

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.800
"Behold the divine token of mystery."

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.940
"All heroes shall bow immediately."

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.550
The divine token?

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.750
Three fingerprints.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:15.030
These 3 fingerprints
belong to the 3 grandmasters:

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.440
Tianzheng, Taichan, and Zhichen.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.320
Could this be the true Hero Command Token?

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.030
Rumor has it

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.600
that the "Voidheart Codex" is
inside the Hero Command Token.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.530
But how exactly do I use this thing?

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.150
Could it be hidden as a clue,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.420
waiting for me to uncover?

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.150
Forget it for now.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.940
I'll think about it later.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:43.930
Big Brother.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.090
Big Brother.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.270
I've been looking everywhere for you.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.240
So you're here in the back mountain.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.200
What's the matter?

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.060
It's good news.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.390
Miss Tang sent a message
by carrier pigeon.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.790
She says she's found a way to restore

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.720
your meridians.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.390
[Grand Master Dayin, Biechuan Temple]

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.120
Big Brother,

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.200
I knew there was a way

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.460
to heal your injuries.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:03.400
Let's go.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:27.960
Master, you were injured by Xiao Qiushui's

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.910
internal energy
from the Shaolin and Wudang Sects.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.720
Circulating your qi
can make it better for now,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.650
but it's not a long-term solution.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.960
I'll go get the Herbal King.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.080
Just do your job.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.870
Don't act on your own.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.150
Go do it now.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.960
Master, you haven't fully recovered.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.030
Please be careful.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.200
Go.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.730
Liu Suifeng!

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.400
You've violated the gang rules

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.200
and injured 3 demonic fighters.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.720
Are you trying to rebel against Chief?

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.069
I was acting on Chief's orders.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.390
How could that be rebellion?

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.790
At Xiao's Sword Manor,

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.160
you killed the sect leaders
of both Shaolin and Wudang.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.270
Do you know how much trouble

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.270
you've brought upon the Power Gang?

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.270
I was following orders.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.010
Following orders, you say?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.030
Look at this.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.400
Chief's token?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
By Chief's order,
you are to be arrested, Liu Suifeng.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.180
If you've got any excuses,

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.990
save them for Chief later.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.920
Guards!

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.070
No need for that.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.690
If Chief truly wants to see me,

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.140
I'll go by myself.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.960
Chief,

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.510
I've brought Liu Suifeng as ordered.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.720
Good.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.790
Hanshan,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.720
you may leave now.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.160
Chief, Liu Suifeng
harbors rebellious thoughts.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.490
I fear he might harm you.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.570
He won't. Go.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:01.680
Yes.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.310
Suifeng, come here.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.680
Suifeng.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.850
Do you remember this painting?

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.070
When the Power Gang was first founded,

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.070
you got the 7 of us brothers together

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.370
to paint this "Mountains After Snow."

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.010
When we drew this painting,

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.310
the 7 of us were each

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.200
supposed to paint a peak.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.550
But you refused,

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.230
saying you'd only paint pine trees.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.110
So there are only 6 peaks
in this painting.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.810
Back then, the 7 of us

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.720
fought countless battles
in founding the Power Gang.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.050
Only you and I survived.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.770
Your martial skills are impressive.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.870
Having you paint just pine trees
was an injustice.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.310
If there were to be
a highest peak in this painting,

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.490
you'd be the one to paint it.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:12.740
Chief,

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.740
I only wish to serve you
until my last day.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.550
I'd never overstep my bounds.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.140
Tianzheng and Taichan

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.020
were 2 legends of the martial world.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:37.840
One must observe
proper formalities even just to meet them.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.260
But you,

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.900
you killed them just like that,

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.450
forcing Shaolin and Wudang

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.410
to become the Power Gang's sworn enemies.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.010
If it weren't for you,

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.010
White Phoenix wouldn't have been
exposed and killed.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.750
Since you're so capable,

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.960
why do you humble yourself before me?

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.700
I killed Tianzheng and Taichan because…

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.480
I just received a secret report.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.160
The sect leaders of Shaolin and Wudang
have rushed to the Xiao Residence.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.270
Go stop them.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.440
End their lives.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.880
Someone impersonated me
and ordered you to kill them?

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.960
Yes.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.500
I failed to retrieve
the Hero Command Token in time

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.760
and disappointed you.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.650
I was desperate to make amends.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.680
B-But I never imagined

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.920
someone could impersonate you

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.030
so perfectly.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.770
One can always be outdone.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.880
If you had the ability
to kill Tianzheng and Taichan,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.110
someone else had the ability to fool you.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.030
You have my undying loyalty, Chief.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:47.910
I never dared

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.910
to question your orders.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.720
I never thought I'd be used like this.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.350
But I never acted on my own or intended

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.920
to rebel against you.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.000
I already said—

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.290
you wouldn't rebel.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.160
What disappoints me is

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.440
that everything is falling apart now.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:14.920
Suifeng.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.840
How many years have you followed me?

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.350
Fifteen years.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.640
Fifteen years.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.570
Even if that guy's disguise was perfect,

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.360
you should have known

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.240
I'd never give such an order.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.630
Was his disguise really that good,

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.200
or have you grown so overconfident

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.250
that you became careless?

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.550
People say that the Power Gang

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.680
rules the martial world
and does whatever it pleases.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.140
You've heard this so often

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.570
that you've forgotten

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.920
why we established this gang
in the first place.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.720
I dare not forget.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.720
I know my mistake is unforgivable.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.950
Please punish me, Chief.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.160
Get up.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.400
After the coming palm strike,

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.440
whether you live or die,

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:28.790
you will no longer be
part of the Power Gang.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.980
Big Brother.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:05.730
Big Brother.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:08.600
Your Highness.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.310
I've decided to set off right now

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.350
to Biechuan Temple
to find Grand Master Dayin.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.030
When Miss Tang sent the message,

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.960
I thought you should set off early.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.590
But that place isn't safe right now.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.240
I heard on my way here

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.160
that Zhu the Great King and the Power Gang

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.420
have come to blows near Yunxia Mountain.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.920
How dare Zhu the Great King

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.440
challenge the Power Gang?

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.360
His influence used to be

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.640
limited to the waterways on Long River.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.810
But the Power Gang has too many rules.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.920
And with the Hero Command Token incident,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.270
they made enemies
with both Wudang and Shaolin,

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.480
so Zhu the Great King
seized the opportunity to win people over.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.920
Those lone fighters who dislike rules

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.510
and enemies of the Power Gang

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.970
have all joined his ranks.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.750
Many territories of the Power Gang

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.720
now belong to Zhu the Great King.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.260
Your Highness,

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.530
do you know about a man
called Shao Liulei?

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.150
Years ago in the battle
at Wuxing Mountain,

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.790
he was Zhu the Great King's subordinate

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.240
but betrayed him during the chaos.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.810
He helped Crazy Yan escape

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.700
and disappeared with him for many years.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.540
This conflict at Yunxia Mountain

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.200
is likely connected to him.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.480
You mean

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.640
Zhu the Great King and the Power Gang

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.270
want more than just Shao Liulei
and the Infinite Pill;

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.880
they want clues about Crazy Yan more.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.510
Exactly.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.440
Okay.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.400
Then I should hurry up

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.070
and rescue

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.640
Grand Master Dayin from this chaos.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.840
Big Brother.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.890
I'll go with you.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.400
There are many maze formations
around Biechuan Temple.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.480
I learned some formation techniques
at the Hailin Sect.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.280
I can help you.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.790
Okay.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.350
Fewer people will draw less attention.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.480
Qiu, you stay here

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.720
and wait for our good news.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.720
Yes, Big Brother.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:02.830
Farewell.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.820
Wait, Qiushui.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.920
Biechuan Temple
doesn't receive ordinary visitors.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.160
Give this letter of introduction
to the monk who receives you.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.490
He will lead you inside.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:11.830
[From Liang Dou]

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:12.960
I'm leaving at once.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.720
With the martial world in such chaos,

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.270
all sects must unite to face it.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.140
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:22.680
Take care.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.120
Let's go.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.500
Chief wants you to go back.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.960
Don't kneel here anymore.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.410
Blade King,

please let me see Chief.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.880
You know Chief ordered me
to enforce the gang rules.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.590
Though I have the Misery Pill,

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.840

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.590
I can still kill you effortlessly.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.340
I only want one meeting with Chief

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.730

Please speak to Chief on my behalf.

Your mistake this time is too serious.

There's nothing I can do.

I'm not trying to avoid punishment.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.770
I just want Chief to grant me death.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.850
It's better than being expelled
from the Power Gang.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.360
Why do you have to do this?

If he no longer wants me,

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.710
what's the point of me staying alive?

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.230
If you're willing to die for Chief,

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.010

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.890

struck by tragedy not long ago.

to repair meridians,

there was only a 50% chance of success.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.910
whether to risk your life or not.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.260

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.640
I'm not the only one looking for you.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.510
Many people are looking for you.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.160
Are you sent by the Power Gang
or Zhu the Great King?

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.400
Tell me!

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:57.020
C-Crazy… Crazy Yan.

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:05.960
Crazy Yan, Crazy Yan, Crazy Yan.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.550
Crazy Yan.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:17.440
What's your relationship with Crazy Yan?

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.510
Mr. Shao,

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.190
Crazy Yan is my elder brother.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:30.790
Okay, I see.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.940
The Infinite Pill has the yin part
and the yang part.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.800
Take both together
and you get 60 years' worth of power.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:40.150
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.560
But my elder brother, Crazy Yan,

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.290
only gave you the yang pill.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.560
When you took the yang pill,

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:50.490
the yang energy
exploded through your body,

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.760
causing you excruciating pain.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:55.000
M-Mr. Shao,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
please don't cry.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:00.670
If I can heal your internal injuries,

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:03.800
would you like to try?

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:06.700
Is Mr. Yan here?

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.150
Is Mr. Yan here?

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.850
If Mr. Yan could come,

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.080
no one could stop him.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.710
Right.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.670
Right.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.680
So many people have come.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:33.480
Who are they?

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.150
They're all here looking for you.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.670
Are you mistaken?

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:43.360
Impossible.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.630
Shao Liulei wouldn't hide far away.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:49.750
We haven't seen the target yet,

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:51.610
but our opponents have caught up.

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:53.880
So annoying.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.280
Wherever we go,

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:57.280
you follow right behind us.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.720
Shao Liulei is one of us
from the waterways.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:02.590
Li Chenzhou shouldn't be after him.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.190
You haven't found him either.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:07.590
So why are you on our tail?

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.070
We've been at this for days.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.030
All those small skirmishes led us nowhere.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.690
Why don't we settle this
with a real fight today?

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.370
You think we're afraid of you?

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.760
Everyone's here.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.830
Song Mingzhu,

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.090
you came at the right time.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.360
With you here,

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.150
those guys won't last long.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.420
Master sent me to find Shao Liulei.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.860
I don't recall him sending any of you.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:47.330
We're just acting in Chief's interests.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:50.400
Good.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.570
Go on and fight.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.380
I'll go take a walk.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:05.630
Come, come.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.030
Why did Mr. Yan

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:12.440
send you to me?

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.140
Has Shao Liulei never met Mr. Yan?

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:21.840
He said he's felt bad
about how he's treated you

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:23.000
over the years.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.590
He wants me to teach you

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:29.550
a method to remove
the yang energy from your body.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.760
What method?

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.360
What he means is,

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.760
if you return the Infinite Pill,

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.310
he'll tell you about the method.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.450
I've got it right here.

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:55.590
This pill

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.680
had been with Mr. Yan for many years.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.120
He never needed it.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.100
Why does he suddenly want it back

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:01.960
after I took it?

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.550
Actually,

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:12.030
my brother doesn't want it for himself.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.920
He and I have reunited,

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.360
and he wants to give this pill to me.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:20.320
To you?

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:24.920
If you don't believe me,

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:26.450
you can check my pulse.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.150
I've lost all my martial arts skills.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:30.190
No need for that.

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.700
I tested you just now.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.350
You have no martial arts skills.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.250
Open your mouth.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.340
So this is the Infinite Pill.

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:52.240
I'll take it.
