=Voyage to Haihun, Season 2=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.300
=Episode 20=

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.920
These past days,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.230
I've traveled through Yuzhang.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.640
Thanks to your efforts,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.120
the land is at peace

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.100
and people are content.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.130
It brings me great comfort.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.980
Thank you, Kang.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.320
You...

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.640
hold an important post.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.610
I hope you'll return to Chang'an soon

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.070
for the Xiqiang conflict.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.790
Only with you leading the army

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.760
can I put my mind at ease.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.520
Kang,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.760
trust me,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.210
General Zhao will surely claim victory.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.540
It seems you can't

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.320
part with the people and matters here.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.640
I wouldn't dare.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.030
The Xiqiang woman
who stirred up Wucheng Village

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.910
has now appeared in Yuzhang.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.660
She is a spy from Xiqiang.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.520
It's likely tied to the Duke of Guangling.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.080
I will track her down as soon as possible

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.120
and bring her to justice.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.350
Let me investigate.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.080
By the way,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.310
while I was here,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.800
I met an old friend we both know.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.360
Rest assured,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.560
we had a great talk.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.240
Since it's an old friend,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.710
why not head to Chang'an together?

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.260
He harbors no deceit.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.180
Heng.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.910
Once we return to Chang'an,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.500
I can no longer be Kang Ning

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.840
and he can no longer be Qi Chang.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.150
What will the court think,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.520
and how will the realm see it?

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.270
I trust you.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.870
Let General Zhao lead the army to war.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.980
If you can't let go of matters here,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.360
then root out the Xiqiang spies
before returning.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.640
Remember this well,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.030
I permit only you to return.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.790
Mistress,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.870
I saw De Jiu with a company of riders

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.000
cross into Haihun's borders.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.150
In that carriage,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.420
it must be Liu Xun.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.160
Good.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.990
It's finally time to act.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.970
Mistress,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.950
if we can capture the Emperor this time

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.280
and deliver him to the Duke,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.760
our rise to glory will be within reach.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.350
Do you really think I seize the Emperor

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.940
just to earn a post
from the Duke of Guangling?

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.050
Once we have the Emperor in hand,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.090
leave no chance for survival.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.900
This...

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.750
Make sure by tomorrow,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.960
all the remaining Mishenfu
is brought here.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.950
I have my own plans for it.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.630
Be quick.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.740
Yes.

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.190
I obey.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.850
The road to Chang'an is long.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.620
Kang, you must be cautious.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.410
When you return to Chang'an,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.840
join me in shaping a grand legacy.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.870
Yes.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.380
De Jiu, you stay here.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.150
Your Majesty.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.110
I...

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.520
I can see the reluctance
in Heng's eyes.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.920
But your safety matters more, Kang.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.480
So you admit you're reluctant, Heng.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.220
Rest assured.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.900
I have the Huben Army with me.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.330
You remain in Yuzhang.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.310
Keep tracking the Xiqiang spies.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.440
Once the task is done,

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.900
you and De Jiu

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.050
will return to Chang'an.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.500
Thanks, Your Majesty.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.770
I accept the order.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.190
Though this mission

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.420
is important,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.320
do not hesitate, Heng.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.640
What a fine young lady.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.170
This is as far as I can help you.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.300
You're burdened with state affairs.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.460
Such trifles should not trouble you.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.300
Trifles?

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.410
That's not trifles.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.370
This concerns your lifelong happiness.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.170
Of course, I keep it close to heart.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.160
Alright, I hear you.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.760
Don't just brush me off.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.960
Or I'll issue

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.730
an imperial decree,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.900
granting you two a marriage.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.090
No, that's not necessary.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.850
This is not something to rush.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.370
I already have a plan.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.870
You have a plan?

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.290
Good, that eases my mind.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.700
But don't just lie back.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.950
Get to it, quickly.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.520
Alright, alright, I got it.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.380
Continue the inspection on my behalf.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.530
Look closely at my people.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.040
Choose true talents for the Great Han.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.840
Only in this way,

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.630
can the Great Han truly prosper.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.580
So report everything to me truthfully.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.650
We swear to ease your burdens

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.290
and seek blessings for the people.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.330
Farewell, Your Majesty.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.430
What did you just say?

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.360
What's not necessary?

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.880
Nothing.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.170
Nothing at all.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.860
(Haihun Marquis's Mansion)

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.370
De Jiu.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.790
Last time, I meant to give you

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.400
this arc-shaped jade,

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.540
but didn't get the chance.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.460
So this is the surprise you spoke of?

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.280
Do you know

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.850
the difference
between the this jade and me?

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.170
You are a man,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.700
and it is an object.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.640
It's written with one more stroke.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.870
And that change

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.980
makes it

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.410
the Alioth,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.380
the brightest one in the Big Dipper.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.050
So

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.690
whenever you look up,

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.240
you'll find me there.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.810
And then?

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.720
It failed again...

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.970
I've been working
on that explanation for ages.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.720
Can't you be a little moved?

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.760
I like...

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.350
Like what?

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.230
The arc-shaped jade.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.080
Remove the stroke.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.130
The star and your name share
the same characters.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.040
But for the jade pendant,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.900
it's written in a totally different way.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.840
Written like this.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.080
The surprise is about to arrive.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.990
What are you talking about?

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.140
Why is Senior's face flushed?

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.230
It's my robe reflecting light.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.550
What kind of surprise?

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.550
Hope it's not a fright.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.470
The Marquis prepared this for you.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.080
Me?

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.300
Of course. Let's go.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.800
You'll know when you see it. Let's go.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.610
Let's go take a look too.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.120
This is the Immortal's dwelling.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.520
Isn't that a fairyland?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.570
Hurry, tell me more.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.410
My own house

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.240
is several times taller
than the tallest building here.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.230
When it comes to night,

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.790
the whole city blazes with light.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.220
It's so bright you can't see the stars.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.170
Carriages on the street need no horses.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.950
They move on their own.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.880
If we go to Chang'an,

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.670
we could take a plane.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.180
We'd arrive in just two hours.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.960
Two hours to reach Chang'an?

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.110
What's a plane?

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.150
A kind of transport.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.610
People ride it and soar into the air.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.000
Bravo!

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.120
A reward.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.840
They say this thing

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.290
once eased my grandfather's longing
for my grandmother.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.560
Heng,

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.360
I suppose you must miss your homeland.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.610
Yet your homeland lies so far away.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.030
I can only picture it
based on your description.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.720
With this method,

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.030
you'll be drawn deep into it.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.080
Heng,

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.200
this is the surprise
I've prepared for you.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.000
Buddy,

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.230
for that irresistible sense of ceremony

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.870
and this film from two millennia ago,

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.710
I'll drink to that.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:17.790
Come on,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.110
let's all drink together.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.520
Heng,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:40.030
what is this "film" you just mentioned?

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.640
De Jiu.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:45.580
Let's share a drink.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.510
You don't usually wear jewelry.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.320
Is this a gift from Wang?

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.110
Mm.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.320
A film

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.960
is the eternity of time and space.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.590
Far greater than the Mandate of Heaven?

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.260
Let me tell you a secret.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:34.710
Alright.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.130
Actually…

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.750
I came here from 2,000 years
in the future.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:42.790
Shh.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.950
The Mandate of Heaven I mentioned

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.060
is written word for word

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.520
in the records of a history book.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.310
Heng,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.510
you've had too much to drink.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.330
You're the one who's drunk.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.400
If you're really from the future,

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.670
then let's play a game.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.130
What kind of game?

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.430
I'll bury something underground,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.880
then tell you a secret phrase.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.510
When you return,

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.800
you can decipher that phrase

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.120
and dig up what I buried.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.210
Isn't that awfully childish?

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.320
Isn't it kind of fun?

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.670
Not fun at all.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.520
Pour me some wine.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.370
No way.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.360
Back then,

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.660
I always felt I didn't belong here.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.250
I was sure I could return.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.670
I missed home.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.740
I missed my family.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.870
So I avoided forming any bonds here.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.910
But now I've figured it out.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.560
Holding back only hurts everyone.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:19.720
I might as well follow my heart.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.660
I choose to stay.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.420
Because

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.750
you're the ties I can't escape.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.600
Heng,

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.660
I even gave you a film.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.960
Aren't you giving me a gift?

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.960
Who says I'm giving you a gift?

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.280
Go away.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.450
Wang even gave De Jiu a piece of jewelry.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.780
So, what will you give me?

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.550
The entire mansion and I are yours.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.670
Come, let's share a drink.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.910
Marquis, what business brings you to me?

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.050
When we searched for a mausoleum site,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.350
didn't we find another blessed land?

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.200
Do you recall where it was?

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.160
I remember.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.680
You are the Governor.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.540
No one knows Yuzhang better than you.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.380
Write it down for me.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.720
That's easy enough.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:29.760
It's by the waters...

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Don't write it plainly.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.510
Turn it into a coded riddle.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:35.790
Others can puzzle it out,

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.000
yet not uncover it too easily.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.200
Don't make it direct.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.320
Nor can it be confused.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.160
You understand?

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.250
I understand.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.600
But that's not quite...

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.100
Enough talk, get on with it.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.500
It's just a secret phrase.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.800
(Yuzhang)
It took you so long.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.340
It must show not only

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.870
your clever mind,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.750
but also be something
Lord Wang can guess.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.240
So it must be precise.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.350
Report! Bad news!

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.650
The Governor's army has revolted!

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:01.490
What?

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:02.740
The Governor's army?

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.240
Am I not right here myself?

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.280
Quickly inform Lord Wang.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.130
Yes, milord.
