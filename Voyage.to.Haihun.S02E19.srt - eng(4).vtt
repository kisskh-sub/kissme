=Voyage to Haihun, Season 2=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.300
=Episode 19=

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.400
You destroyed Jingkou Village.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.150
You left them with no hope.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.040
Is this your so-called standing firm?

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.040
Their pain at this very moment

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.960
is because of you.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.150
You

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.560
are the real culprit.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.200
Before you arrived,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.680
this little one came over,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.430
looking pitiful.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.310
So I gave it a bite to eat.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.490
It grew quite close to me.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.860
If even livestock are like that,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.870
how much more so would a man be?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.760
The common folk toil from dawn to dusk,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.000
yet can barely scrape by.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.310
They believe what they wish to believe.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.030
Is that really wrong?

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.280
They've done nothing wrong.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.030
They were simply deceived.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.750
The fault lies with the deceivers.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.910
You've been searching for this,

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.080
haven't you?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.520
Why is the Qilin with you?

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.470
Because I am Li Nvxu,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.590
Lan'er in your eyes,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.870
and the Mistress in their words.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.440
So it was you all along.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.080
It was me.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.400
If you and I join hands,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.160
then after it's done,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.160
this Qilin will be yours.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.710
What is it you wish for?

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.280
And what schemes are you after?

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.380
You're finally awake.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.310
It's like I died and came back.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.130
You've been out cold for two days.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.020
What time is it now?

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.220
What… what time?

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.030
Wang, perfect timing you woke.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.900
Qingge.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.400
Why are you here?

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.910
Wang, you're still half-dreaming.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.050
Where else would I be?

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.390
Hurry, the Duke is coming back.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.520
The Duke?

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.660
Where did the Duke go?

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.100
He went to see Huo Guang,
as you planned.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.400
Huo Guang… Chang'an...

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.800
Uncle and the others have arrived.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.010
Ren Xuan?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.190
What is going on?

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.990
How come I don't know?

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.210
Before you passed out,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.430
you said to lure Huo Guang here today

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.280
and then end him.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.160
What?

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.310
You left my marital uncle
with no resting peace.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.750
You ruined his lifetime of honor.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.170
Today, I'll avenge him.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.030
You caused the heroes
of Wucheng Village to perish.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.360
The ground ran red with blood.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.590
You are the one to blame.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.860
The brothers of Changyi died due to you.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.120
I will avenge them as well.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.870
Not me, it wasn't me.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.840
Wang.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.570
The Duke treated you so well,
why would you...?

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.770
Why?

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.480
All because of your selfish desires.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.430
No, I didn't. I'm innocent.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.330
Yes.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.140
Everyone died because of you.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.090
Go up.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.320
Who are you?

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.990
Are you one of Huo Guang's men?

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.160
Do you truly believe

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.610
it was Huo Guang who killed them?

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.680
Are you with Li Nvxu?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.630
Not that either.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.600
Then who are you really?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.390
The one behind it all.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.000
Whose orders are you following?

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.160
The Mandate of Heaven.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.430
Who are you, truly?

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.980
Who told Liu He that he must do

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.070
all those absurd things for a chance?

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.210
Who sent Ren Xuan
to gather his brothers and leave

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.230
the village to aid?

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.400
And who, in the end,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.070
led all the brothers of Changyi
to Wucheng Village?

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.050
It's me, Wang Heng.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.480
Because only I know the Mandate of Heaven.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.480
Only Wang Heng could cause
everyone's death.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.390
Who are you, really?

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.240
Why do you look exactly like me?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.240
Look like?

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.600
I am you.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.120
You are not me.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.720
I am you.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.370
And you are me.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.400
If you don't die,
how can you kill me?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.120
It was us who took their lives.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.390
Only with one death

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.000
can we face them with honor.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.750
The one to blame.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.650
Kill, kill, kill.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.510
The one to blame.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.330
Kill, kill, kill.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.280
The one to blame.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.360
Kill, kill, kill.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.950
The one to blame.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.250
Kill, kill, kill!

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.310
The one to blame.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.320
Kill, kill, kill!

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.050
Yes.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.630
Only death can bring justice for them.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.900
Heng.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.880
Heng, Heng!

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.480
Quickly,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.460
catch Lan'er.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.430
She is Li Nvxu.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.340
She is the Mistress.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.950
Capture any suspicious woman nearby.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.070
- Medicine.
- Get it.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.680
Why are you so late?

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.950
A strange mist suddenly appeared.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.120
I lost my way.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.920
Did you catch Li Qi?

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.400
No.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.140
Scalp Wang was mesmerized by him.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.630
The citywide search is ongoing.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.310
The one behind Li Qi is Lan'er.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.200
What?

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.230
Could it be love turned to hate?

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.490
Unrequited love, perhaps.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.760
I need some water.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.800
Alright.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.940
Let's go.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.150
Slow down.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.360
Our plan to lure the enemy out worked.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.430
How can you be so sure?

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.170
They've plotted this move
for over a decade.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.380
Very cautious, every step.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.740
At your mansion,
they found no chance to act.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.360
So they tried to divide us

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.480
and strike one by one.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.510
I see.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.040
Marquis,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.800
Lord Sun warned this place is dangerous.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.750
Return to the mansion.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.890
- Alright.
- Okay.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.190
Go.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.830
That way.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.950
Report. Nothing over there.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:20.900
Search that side next.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:21.750
Yes.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.480
Lord Wang, Marquis.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.070
Lord Sun.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.000
Lan'er is the Xiqiang woman, Li Nvxu.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.170
The Mistress they spoke of.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.600
The true mastermind behind it all.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.630
Make sure she and Li Qi are brought in.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.670
Beware of Mishenfu.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.440
Someone dares to frame you.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.610
I'll find her, no matter what.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.080
Men! With me!

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.920
Yes.

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.390
That way.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.890
After they're caught,

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.870
will the truth behind Wucheng Village,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.080
Mishenfu,

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.840
Xiqiang spies all be revealed?

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.350
There must be a greater force
behind this.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.310
No matter what, this time,

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.740
I won't let you take risks again.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.080
Rest assured.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.030
If things are as I said,

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.480
then it's beyond
what you and I can face.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.910
I will inform His Majesty at once.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.150
Let him take care of this.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.080
That would be best.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.100
Just now,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.570
I came to realize a few things.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.680
What things?

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.670
What I truly value most.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.200
And what is that?

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.550
High rank, wealth,

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.150
fame, and prestige.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.080
Wang Heng!

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.430
None of these truly matter.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.840
Then what matters?

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.930
You and I are still buddies.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600
That's what truly counts.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.770
(Records from the Book of Han,)

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.920
(Yuankang Year 4,
under Emperor Xuan of Han,)

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.830
(envoys were sent to tour the realm)

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.390
(to observe the lives of the people)

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.590
(and seek out the talents.)

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.300
(That year and the following year,)

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.250
(titles and gifts were granted.)

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.270
(Land taxes were remitted
in places he passed,)

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.760
(revealing his will
to let the people prosper.)

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.910
(Emperor Xuan of Han went incognito
to Haihun.)

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.240
After entering the city, De Jiu,

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.030
you go meet the patrol officers first.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.900
Have them arrange the journey reports.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.510
When I arrive, I'll hear them.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:08.880
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.590
Morning, Marquis.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.490
I was just about to visit you.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.220
What's going on?

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.720
A distinguished guest came by today.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.200
He booked my entire tea stall.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.360
Marquis, Marquis!

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.990
Kang Ning.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.040
Kang.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.740
Qi Chang.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.840
Qi.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.430
- Please.
- Please.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.160
Kang.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.340
It's been years.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.180
Where's your sword?

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.080
Have you taken a new path of chivalry?

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.360
You still remember
what I said back then.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.400
Of course, I remember.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.720
The folk heroes

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.790
care about right from wrong.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.630
The court heroes

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.150
care about the people.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.840
I suppose you've served in the court.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.350
The court is another kind
of martial world.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.360
It's not only about the clash of swords,

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:18.870
but a battle of hearts.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.510
Come on.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.120
Have some tea.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.840
I thought we'd never meet again.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.670
When will we meet again?

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.480
Where will we meet again?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.080
It's all in Heaven's hands.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.640
But our bond is like this tea.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.940
Though we drink from different cups,

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.710
it's poured from the same pot.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.540
One source, flowing apart.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.120
Blood ties bind us.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.080
They cannot be severed.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.200
All my life, I've achieved little.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.960
Yet Kang, you never turned away

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.970
and still share a pot of tea with me.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.760
I speak from the heart,

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.520
that's my greatest fortune.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.410
Have some tea.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.830
Life is still long.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.000
Let the past be.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.750
Fear not the future.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.940
Let's speak of the present.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.000
A cup of tea,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.080
an old friend,

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.160
that's enough.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.750
Kang.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.330
The Great Han grows stronger by the day.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.230
Please tell His Majesty
on behalf of me, a humble citizen,

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.080
he is open-minded

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.650
and full of wisdom within.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.350
A true enlightened ruler.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.230
I shall convey it without fail.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.510
This is also what the Marquis
wishes to tell His Majesty.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.030
The Marquis and I are on friendly terms.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.320
He

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:01.900
always ends up drunk.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.600
When he drinks too much,
he stares at the sky.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.630
Not a single word said.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.910
That day, he emptied all jars
in the wine shop,

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.280
drunk beyond reason.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.940
He couldn't even stand straight.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.020
I had to carry him back myself.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.550
When he lay on my back,
he started rambling.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.670
He said…

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.640
the throne was never what he sought.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.260
He was unfit for it.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.330
But he wished to return to Chang'an
to honor his ancestors.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.300
Other than that…

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.360
he had no further desires.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:54.200
His Majesty once spoke of his uncle.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.840
What exactly did he say?

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.940
He wished the Marquis
could enjoy cockfights

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.500
and horse races in Haihun,

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.480
to live a carefree life
that belonged to Liu Bingyi.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:13.600
Kang.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.560
Qi.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:15.920
I have matters to do.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.110
Until we meet again some day.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.220
I hope

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.320
we truly meet again one day.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.680
Remember to address him Lord Kang later.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.040
Lord Kang.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.480
I wonder if he'll be pleased
with these arrangements.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.080
Sometimes no plan is the best plan.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.720
Lord Kang.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.560
We were unaware of your arrival.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.750
Please forgive us

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.600
for not greeting you sooner.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:14:59.780
Lord Kang.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.910
I have prepared a carriage for you.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.200
I wish to accompany you to tour Haihun.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.880
So you've set my schedule for me.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.940
You shouldn't trouble yourself
with travel matters.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.990
Such duties are my responsibility.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.290
Lord Sun,

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.860
I'm here on a royal incognito inspection

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:24.870
for the purpose of

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.130
seeing how the people of Haihun live.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.520
You make all the arrangements for me.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.550
Then how can I know the truth?

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.720
Forgive my rudeness,
I spoke out of turn.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.150
I spoke out of turn.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.840
Alright, I'll have a look around.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.220
No need to follow me.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.780
(Common Joy Market)

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.780
- Your...
- Thank you.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:06.750
Heng.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.200
This is a private tour in disguise.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.030
For now, just call me Kang Ning.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.360
No need for so much formality between us.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.080
I figured you would be here by now.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.030
And that the first thing you would do

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.670
is come to see this Common Joy Market.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.880
The name of this market is well chosen.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.920
Joy of the people.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.350
Sharing joy with the people.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.020
Heng, don't you wish for me to come here?

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.050
Kang, you can't be serious.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.040
I wouldn't dare.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.750
I'm only worried
the journey might tire you.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.600
Would you care to
stroll with me in the market?
