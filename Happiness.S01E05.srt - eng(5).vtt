00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.290
Seo Yoon, I'm back!

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.350
Mom?

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.120
The call cannot be connected so...

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.060
Is there something going on outside?

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.420
Oh, this? It's dangerous if people try to bite you.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.790
I can't reach Mom.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.840
I even texted her just now.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.690

[No service]

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.470
I think there's a problem with the base station. I'm sure you'll be able to reach her later.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.080
If someone knocks, don't ever open the door.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.390
I will be back quickly so just watch TV, okay?

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.180
But the TV doesn't work either.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.760
What?

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.070
[Announcement]

[Announcement: Stay where you are and wait for the rescue unit.]

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.980
I think that's enough now.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.980
We have to block it more.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.860
You saw them earlier.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.330
Go over there and get some rest.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.920
Okay.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.440
Hyung, keep your eyes on him.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.060
Okay.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.750
Hey, hey, hey. Don't look over here.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.760
Look at the wall. The wall.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.950
[The entire staff...]

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.960
Why? You said the infected are outside.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.700
But it's too quiet.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.300
Hey, hey, hey! Look at the wall.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.920
What is all this?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.460
Ahjussi, what are you doing right now?

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.350
Well...

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.270
What is this?

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.900
[Happiness]

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.890

[Episode 5]

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.620
- Dong Hyun.
- What?

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.730
About the symptoms of Madman Rabies...

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.060
Do you know when your heart beats fast

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.560
and the scratch becomes itchy and hot?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.330
That's menopause!

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.190
Geez, what are they doing instead of working?

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.030
In which building is the management office located?

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.930
Which building was it?

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.360
Oh, it's next to the children's library.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.200
Gosh, forget it. I will find it.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.790
Dong Hyun. Son.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.820
That's menopause. Menopause!

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.360
Hey, it's true. Don't you trust me?

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.270
No, and I trust you even less about this.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.020
Hey, it's true! All the people in other buildings are infected!

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.410
Their eyes rolled back, and they were all walking around like this! I swear!

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.190
Darn it.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.080
What are you doing?

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.010
Gosh, my children... They should be okay, right?

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.430
I'm sure they're better off out there than here.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.260
Oh, Ahjumma, you live in unit 401, right?

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.910
Is your internet not working, either?

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.590
I'm not an ahjumma.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.590
Both my internet and cell phones aren't working.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.310
I heard the people in other buildings are all infected. Did you hear as well?

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.170
Really? Daebak...

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.360
Who told you that? The TV?

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.670
That person over there. Ask him.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.130
It's true. It really is.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.120
What?

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.360
What's going on here?

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.270
Hold on. Excuse me.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.860
Don't do that here. Go to the gym.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.260
Everyone is there.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.700
- Who is "everyone"?
- The residents.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.150
Do you see it?

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.700
This... Is this really blood?

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.930
Would it be ketchup then?

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.780
- I'm not the only one who saw them.
- I saw them, too.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.860
Mr. Lee from the maintenance office got infected, and his eyes turned all white...

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.020
And like this... like this...

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.860
It's because I don't understand.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.460
How could the people who were throwing a fit just this morning about locking our building residents up

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.940
all get infected since then?

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.030
Oh, hello...

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.410
Oh, that's real blood! Whose blood is it?

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.970
- No...
- Put your phone down.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.430
Let's go over there and talk.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.060
Oh? Is that blood?

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.500
- Aigoo, is this...
- Don't do that.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.660
- Get away from there.
- This is real blood.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.400
Are you doing this to scare me?

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.870
- What are you talking about?
- Are you trying to replace me as the resident representative?

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.700
Someone is playing a joke. It's obvious.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.960
Building Representative.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.670
How do you open this? Dong Hyun, do you know how to open this?

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.290
Representative or whatever, I'm not interested so don't worry.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.880
Step away! It's dangerous outside.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.220
- I mean...
- You can't go outside.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.260
- I just need a few minutes.
- Get away from here, please.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.580
- I think a person just walked by.
- Can't you see this?

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.670
- You have no idea what's out there...
- We are so curious.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.490
- Please calm down, and stay away.
- Children are playing a joke!

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.570
- Just open it.
- It's too frustrating.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.060
Put that phone down!

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.620
- Please calm down.
- I mean...

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.870
- Please get away from the door.
- Sir...

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.960
Where are you going?

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.760
They're trying to open the door. You saw the monster earlier.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.760
Then you shouldn't run away but stop them!

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.290
- Oh, gosh.
- Please stay put.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.520
- Bom, I'm glad you came. Tell them what's out there.
- Gosh, you startled me.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.970
That's it. Yes, it's open. It's open.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.440
Those of you who want to go outside, please go ahead.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.750
Hey, not like this.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.190
Go ahead and leave.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.860
The air underground is too stuffy

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.820
so it's not that great for smoking. Right.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.550
How do you give in right away like that?

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.970
All right. I will believe you both just this once.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:31.240
Detective, I won't need to worry about you, right?

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.470
We need to notify the other residents as well.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:09.600
We will also need to discuss our food supply and where the non-residents who are stuck here can stay and eat.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.720
Without the management office, we can't broadcast, and the internet is down. How are we supposed to notify them?

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.200
We can go and tell them in person.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.160
Where is your gun?

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.150
Jung Gook has it.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.770
What did the man from downstairs say when he handcuffed you?

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.540
Physical liberty is a vital constitutional right.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.340
He can't do that without due process.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.340
Actually, I don't remember that well. I don't think he said much.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.250
I don't think he told me my rights clearly.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.410
Then does the police have any proof right now?

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:50.540
By chance, you don't think that I killed my wife or something, do you?

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.150
What I think isn't important.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.310
That's for the judicial branch to decide.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:02.630
Well, I... I truly loved my wife Min Ji.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.410
I still can't believe that she's dead.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:11.460
Then we can strategize the defense as a wrongful arrest.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:17.610
That's that... There is a dermatology office that is under my wife's name.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.220
I wonder how the management of inheritance works.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:25.310
Actually, I'm curious about that too.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.630
Well, okay.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:33.560
First of all, we need to exonerate you from the murder charge.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.480
Excuse me.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.360
They want everyone to gather at the gym.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.190
I'll go first so cover me.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.640
Let's switch. I'm better with a bat than you.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.770
You're a pitcher.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:26.170
If I hadn't injured my leg, I would be in the major league.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.040
Let's go.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.740
- Where did everyone go?
- Probably to their apartments.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.430
Since the infected return to normal after a while.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.010
Then what would they think after seeing what they've done?

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:13.220
They would probably regret it, unable to accept what they have done.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.260
Exactly. They would want to hurry home and wash up.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.110
The bloodstains at the entrance.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.750
It looked like someone tried to wipe it off.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.490
They wanted to get rid of the traces of their actions.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.700
The fact that they were craving blood and that they wanted to hide that fact.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.260
[Security]

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.130
I didn't do it.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.290
I just watched.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.070
[Security]

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.450
[Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae Seok]

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.790
I should have gotten a walkie-talkie from him.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.640
What do you think is going on outside?

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.460
There's a high chance it's very chaotic with tons of infected people suddenly showing up.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.090
- Or...
- Or?

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.120
They gave up on this place.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.230
[Blex]

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.730
[Rmand de Brigna Champagne]

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.450
We were going to capture all the Next dealers together,

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.270
but they sensed our effort to arrest them and locked themselves in.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.410
- How many are there?
- Around fifty.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.470
They invited only the members and were partying.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.370
We can open it in five minutes.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.040
Turn off the music.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.630
Turn off the power inside the club.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.510
Don't open the door and block it. Vacate everyone on other floors.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.630
Shut down the building.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.420
Go up and shut down the building.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:02.380
If you need something, go ahead and spend it.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.730
You're in a good mood all of a sudden.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.660
They say everyone outside is infected.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.330
Is that a good thing?

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.800
I won't need to go to jail anymore. I only have to quietly look for a chance to clear my name in here.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.790
You must've come up with a plan.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.830
I just have to shut up the couple downstairs.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.500
They'll keep bugging me once the lockdown is lifted. I have to convince them before then.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:28.600
You're on my side anyway, right?

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.080
Do I have to go, too?

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.520
A lawyer should show his face at times like this so we can get more consultations requests.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.700
Honey, they say our building is okay.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.000
Gosh, it's not because I'm scared.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.800
I just can't believe that everyone in the other buildings is infected.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.550
You sound scared.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.990
Are you going to the neighborhood meeting?

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.760
I'm not scared of infected people at all.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.590
The residents won't like you much, though.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:02.550
I'm sure a lot of people think that you caused the lockdown.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.830
I told you I'm innocent, didn't I?

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.960
Where is Woo Sang Hee?

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:13.150
Sang Hee cares about what other people think. Just like the lawyer here.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.680

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:49.590
Ma'am, is something out there?

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.780
No...

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.260
You fell pretty hard that day. Did you go to the hospital?

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.420
I'm okay. Gosh...

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.660
- Are you all right?
- Yes...

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.640
That's the grandma who bumped into the lady across the hallway, right?

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.290
Yes, unit 302.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.840
Don't go near her. You might catch it.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.940
I won't catch it.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.900
What are you doing?

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.320
[Broadcasting Station Announcement: Do not move from where you are, and wait for the rescue team to arrive]

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.050
Geez, gosh darn it.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:25.390
Come on! Someone needs to go outside and find out what's going on!

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.690
Are you going to sit back like this?

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.520
The internet is still down. Hurry and come.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.890
Sir, I told you it is dangerous outside.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.580
Everyone got infected, except for those in our building.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.790
Aigoo. Damn it.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.570
I'm so frustrated! Aigoo!

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.390
Gosh, look at her...

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.690
Why did you come? I thought you were feeling weak.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.240
Mom, are you sick?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.190
I'm not sick. I'm just tired.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.930
I saw the bloodstains...

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.970
Are you sure the infected people are everywhere outside?

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.930
We have several witnesses.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:18.160
Do you see that? It says, "Stay where you are."

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.620
Who are the witnesses?

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:30.360
Who are the people who saw the infected people everywhere outside?

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.360
Yes, well... I saw them.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:42.220
- Anyone from the upper floors?
- You mean, not the rentals?

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:47.320
I'm saying this hoping some people can make a more rational determination.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.470
- I...
- Why do you doubt my brother's ability to make a determination?

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.140
My brother works for a corporation. He's a manager.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.900
Yes, I'm a lawyer...

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.830
and my job is to figure out if the testimony has the admissibility of evidence.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.270
You don't have an office and operate the business from home, right?

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.090
- I noticed you advertise in the apartment elevator.
- Geez...

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.830
I'm not "operating a business." I "take on" cases.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.390
- Don't you know what that means?
- I write novels!

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.000

Yes, fine.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.260
I know everyone is hyper-sensitive, but we shouldn't fight among ourselves.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:29.330
I haven't seen infected people, either, but since all your stories match...

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.590
Well...

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.430
I will give you money.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:42.290

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:47.690
it may be little, but I'll pay you 200,000 won.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.500
If it's true that the infected are outside, we should stay inside.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.430
We can share food among ourselves until the situation is clear.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.590
The person who doesn't want to go out... Yes, yes, I got it.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.390

- Did you look around everywhere?
- It's safe in here.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.630
Then I can turn on the elevator, right?

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.970
Sure, go ahead.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:48.660
Ahjumma, I wouldn't get on the elevator if it were me.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.530
You can't escape an infected person from a small space.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.700
I thought I told you to stay home.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.110
Why?

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:04.740
By law, anyone arrested without a warrant can be discharged after forty-eight hours.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.020
Does everyone know that you're a murderer?

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:15.730
What a dangerous thing to say. Do you have a witness?

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:21.970
Excuse me, some of you have seen my wife walking around sick, right?

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:27.050
I was the one who called the ambulance so they could take her away!

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.200
That I couldn't stay by my wife's side until the end,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.930
I acknowledge that.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.830
But my heart hurts the most!

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:38.190
Is it such a crime that I couldn't be with her until the end?

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:41.360
Innocent until proven guilty.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.690
I guess it's a good thing for you that the apartment building is in lock down.

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.570
Don't worry.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:53.600
I'll continue staying at the apartment. Besides, this place isn't so different from jail.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.800
Sir, you have something on your shirt.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.970
Don't think about touching the woman you're with right now.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.530
I'll kill you.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.810
What are you talking about? So unsophisticated.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.680
What crap...

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.430
Let's go.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.210
Please be with all those families who are in pain through these deaths.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.460
Please let them have peace in you, Lord.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.530
You're here.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.630
I pray in the name of Jesus.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.460
Oh Joo Hyung recruited people to go outside.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.180
Were there even people who wanted to go?

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.380
He offered to give them 300,000 won per person so they volunteered.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.010
Honestly, I was tempted, too.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.520
I'll give you 300,000 won each!

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.600
I told them it's dangerous because it's nighttime and pushed it back until morning.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:11.080
Then what about today? We have to figure out our food supply and sleeping arrangements for the people from outside.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.560
Anyone who came from outside,

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.530
if you need anything to eat, come to unit 401.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.050
I'll give you some ramyun and water.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.480
Me, too. Unit 602.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.450
Do you have clothes to change into?

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.810
The residents decided to distribute amongst themselves.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:31.440
At least some people are still caring.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.160
What about Oh Joo Hyung?

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.160
Don't even mention it.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.840
He claimed he has nothing to eat at home and can't give anyone anything.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.470
I guess I'm at fault for even asking.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.360
Take care.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.650
But... why aren't you leaving?

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.980
Earlier, you didn't seem to believe there were infected people all over.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.600
It would be nice if you could go out with everyone else and check for yourself.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.450
I'm a professional.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.260
I can't go at that price.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:07.950
Then how about 1,000,000 won ($1,000) right now?

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:14.060
Mr. Oh Joo Hyung, stop mocking people with money!

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.990
Let's go.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.700
Okay. Rest well.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:27.180
What does that bastard see me as?

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:41.300
Why did you stop me? I was going to kill him!

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:46.590
Honey, what's the point of getting involved with a lunatic like him?

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.510
Should we just not take the job?

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:57.350
There is a dermatology office that is under my wife's name. I wonder how the management of inheritance works.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:02.190
That bastard... I will just send him to jail.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.710
All we need to do is earn money.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.400
I'm fine so look at this and don't worry.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.720
I don't know if this will be enough.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.440
- It's a little heavy.
- Thank you so much.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.650
Before we leave, we will clean up your house for you.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:28.320
It's okay! I live by myself so it's clean.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.450
Don't worry about it. Go on and rest well.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.920
Thank you so much.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.100
Take care.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.950
You... Why did you do that earlier?

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.230
What?

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.260
You took my side.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:53.870
Only I can curse you out. If anyone else does it, it makes me angry.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.090
Right? We are a family, right?

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:01.820
Yes, but you still can't have the house.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.110
Wow, she's cruel.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.640
I'm fine so look at this and don't worry. I'm okay here with Hyun Kyung. If we live here, let's raise a dog.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.680
Where were you trying to go?

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.930
You already know you can't leave the building.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.140
I already told you.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:31.860
- I really left something in the car—
- You drank water, right?
- You took the medicine, right?

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:40.130
I told you I didn't. I really don't know anything about that.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.340
That scared me.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.620
What...

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.490
Seeing as how you're avoiding my eyes, you're definitely hiding something.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.810
If I'm being completely honest, I am hiding something.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:59.790
However, it isn't related to you two.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.030
You did drink.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.950
H-Honestly, what person can live

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:18.660
without drinking water? Well?

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.680
Cut your nails short. I'm going to check in the morning.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.610
If you tell me who bought the drug from you,

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:33.210
I will find a way for you to be more comfortable.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:37.870
When I get out of here, I'm going to sue you.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:38.860
I'm serious.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:43.000
If we get out of here safely, do whatever you want.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.600
Think about it carefully.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:08.030
There we go.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.850
Check the expiration date. It could be old.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:16.070
What's wrong with you? Would there be something like that when it came from a household?

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.920
Do you not take this off even when you're eating?

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.020
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.590
What the...?

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.560
Who is it?

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:31.470
Hello. I'm sorry, but can she stay with you for the time being?

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:34.950
The cleaning dorm is in the basement parking lot,

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.090
and she said she's a little scared to go down.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.480
Oh, sure. Please come in.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.220
I'm glad.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.100
Thank you.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.250
Have a good night.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.490
Thank you.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.360
Come sit.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.250
We were just making ramyun.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.040
Excuse me... Have some.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.290
Thank you.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:16.480
Oh.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.070
Eat slowly. It's hot.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.550
Today was a long day too.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.990
What will we do tomorrow?

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.850
Shouldn't we stop the people from going out tomorrow?

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:40.500
How? Are you going to block the entrance?

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.320
Then they would leave through the basement.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.600
It's impossible with only the two of us.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.410
It could be better to stay locked up in our apartment for the week.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.950
We have food too.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:51.790
It's not like the infected people are going to break through the windows.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.880
What if this doesn't end by the end of the week?

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.930
Then we have to ration our food.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.210
Oh, right.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.410
Keep it a secret from Seo Yoon. There is no reason to worry her more.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.850
Okay.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:18.100
Unni, is it true that there are infected people all over outside?

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.630
What?

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.910
Well... Not in our building, but in the others.

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:28.750
Only our apartment complex has this issue. Everywhere else is normal.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.690
Oh... Was that a secret?

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.880
You should have told me!

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.180
Hyung, I have something to say to you.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.920
No, I just thought...

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.230
once the connection comes back,

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:46.940
you can call your mom again. Until then, we just have to stay here quietly

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.740
until the rescue men come to get us out.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.670
Once there is a vaccine, everything will get better.

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.190
Let's just wait a little bit.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:56.920
I'm okay.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.280
I'm not hurt anywhere, and you said it's better outside than in here.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.890
My parents are probably doing fine outside.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:04.580
Of course.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.450

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.670
Madman Rabies,

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:32.170
also known as Lytta virus, is a nerve disease virus similar to rabies.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.920
It travels through the central nervous system and triggers the brain.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.340
It can only be passed through the blood directly,

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.500
and there are no symptoms before it reaches the brain.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.810
The reason why the infected people mostly attack the neck is also

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:47.350
to reduce the amount of time it takes the reach the brain.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:49.780
Is it fine as long as you are not bitten?

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.390
As of now, you can be infected in three ways.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:55.470
By being bitten, scratched,

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.020
or by taking NEXT.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:00.870
It is suspected that the disease started in people who took NEXT.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.320
What about the development of a treatment?

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:08.680
The problem is that since the brain is the most important part of the body,

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.690
it is being protected by BBB, the blood-brain barrier.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:18.190
Even if we come up with a treatment, it cannot pass the BBB to the brain.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:22.110
So... are you saying it's impossible?

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.580
As of right now, through a disease created in the lab,

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:41.290
we are studying the effects of a new antibody that will directly affect the brain and will have results within a month.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:44.310
Will we be able to endure until then?

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.060
As of now, yes.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.900
However...

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:52.090
if a quarantine does not work,

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:58.780
and the number of infected people surpasses a certain number... within 72 hours or a week at best,

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.290
everything will be over.

You know there's no chance based on the lab results.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:39.220
Without the antibody, all the subjects died.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.530
Then should I say it's impossible to find a treatment?

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:44.830
If we just ask for more time and money...

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:48.100
Then they would just want to kill all the infected.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:54.700
If there is no treatment and the number of infected just increases, there is no answer.

I thought you didn't see the infected as people either, Colonel.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:09.990
If they are people who ripped apart and killed others, they should take responsibility for their actions.

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:11.890
Don't you think so?

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:18.410

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.650
We waited, but they were not coming in.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:00.480
Maybe there's something wrong outside...

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.810
Excuse me! Is there anyone out there?

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.370
[SY Home Cleaning]

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:13.070
Honey!

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.850
Will you continue to stay here?

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:29.960
We have to.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.230
Then keep waiting.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:36.670
We will head in first.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.330
What are they doing there?

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:59.720
They want to leave because they're scared they'll act up again.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:04.300
Then when they can't control their thirst, they'll look for a sacrifice.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.450
What do we do now?

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.360
The supermarket.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.170
We need to have as much food as possible.

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:19.820
Did you really get infected by the Madman Rabies or whatever?

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.680
I already told you, I didn't.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.470
You smoke pot in the States, too.

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:27.420
- Didn't you fix that habit in Korea?
- I really didn't!

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.500
This bastard.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:34.550
I called you here to get close with the residents, and you just stuffed yourself with drugs.

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:35.660
Noona...

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:41.030
You... Don't act as if you know me.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.520
Is it really dangerous outside?

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.070
If it were me... I would never go out.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:08.490
Everyone is so incompetent.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:12.250
I wouldn't get on the elevator if it were me.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:16.360
You can't escape an infected person from a small space.

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.840
Impossible.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.180
How could a person suddenly...

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.980
Madam! Open the door!

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.150
There are patients in the other buildings!

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:45.180
- Really?
- Yes! Hurry!

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:54.540
I even brought information from outside. It's crazy out there.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.700
Okay.

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:02.000
But... did you get hurt somewhere?

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.500
Your neck.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.800
I just got scratched a little.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.160
Just open the door for now.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.140
Hold on.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:21.410
There are some characteristic behaviors seen right before the disease surfaces.

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:24.340
They feel extreme thirst

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:30.920
and when they are alone in an empty space, they display obsessive behaviors, such as knocking on the wall.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.000
By any chance...

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:36.550
are you thirsty?

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:26.360
I mean... Those people did seem weird, but they didn't look dangerous.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.740
Shouldn't we have just waited for the lunchboxes, too?

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:31.800
You can go and wait if you want.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.280
Let's just pack some food first.

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:40.260
More important than food, get more water.

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:52.000
How do we pay for this?

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:58.680
You were raised better than I thought.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.650
No, it's not like that.

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:01.480
What do you mean? I'm right.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.700
I'm just trying follow the rules as much as possible.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:08.740
Once I forego the rules, it'll become lawless.

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.780
Oh, sure.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.890
Of course, Sir.

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:14.640
You're so honest.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.240
You're first-rate.

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.450
I should watch myself.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.230
No—

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:48.340
It's okay. Calm down. Calm down.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.330
No, that!

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:54.800
This!

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.400
Ice cream.

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.790
Go over there.

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:00.440
That one!

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.410
Aigoo.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.200
Food...

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:51.180
What are you doing?

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:55.520
Why, why, why?

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.600
Oh my...

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:01.740
What is that...

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:19.970
Everyone, it's Dong Hyun.

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:22.180
This is the mart.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.260
There is blood all over the floor.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.770
If it's for you all,

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:35.290
I will create the best content by putting myself in danger.

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.530
I love you.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.240
Miss, what are you doing there?

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.550
Miss!

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.800
Be quiet.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.920
Here, The phrase "Take a look" is used.

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.480
A bunch of people suddenly came barging in.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.720
I–

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:54.770
Their eyes were weird... I got scared so I hid here.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:58.340
The infected people... Did they leave?

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.240
I don't know.

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.020
Let's leave.

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:07.100
My gosh!

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:11.560
Inside, there... there's blood!

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.210
Let's leave. What about the others?

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:16.290
I don't know.

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:27.620
Run!

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:52.250
- Why?
- There are people inside.

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:53.630
Hey!

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:54.990
We can't just leave!

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:57.240
Let's go together, that is what I mean.

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.590
Here! Hurry!

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:35.510
What are you doing? Let's go!

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:55.320
Sir!

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.890
Let's go to the first floor.

00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:59.110
Why?

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:03.920
Unni said if she's not back by ten, that we should go downstairs.

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.590
Sure.

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:14.710
Did you really... see them?

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:15.950
I did!

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:19.660
Why did they go outside when it's this dangerous?

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:24.700
What if they all come back infected?

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.210
Yes...

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:40.710
If it's not entirely safe, I can't open this door.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.660
Yes.

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.360
Okay. Go ahead.

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:50.170
That woman is just like me.

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:00.770
What are you doing? Open the door!

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:02.180
Is anyone infected?

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.270
Open the door!

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.790
Come close one by one! I need to see it!

00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:10.030
Hurry and open the door!

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:13.600
Why is there blood on your face? Did you get bitten?

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.940
- Open the door now!
- No, I won't!

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:17.700
Won't you open it? Open it!

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.040
You were bit, weren't you?

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.600
Miss! We are all fine so open the door!

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.350
Open the door. Open the door!

00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:26.160
Sir, open the door!

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.150
Go.

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:30.140
No, we can't.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.860
Open the door!

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:37.990
- Open the door please.
- I will break the windows!

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.050
Honey!

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:44.380
Open it!

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:47.120
What is this sound?

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:47.920
Open the door!

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.760
Min Ji's sound.

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.260
What are you going to do with this now?

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:56.880
I told you, didn't I? We just have to convince the downstairs neighbors. A dead man can't talk.

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.770
Corpses can't talk.

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:01.430
But this...

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:04.170
Hurry.

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:44.930
Hurry and open the door.

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:47.910
Infected people can't come in!

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:49.870
Open the door!

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.040
Open it quick!

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.310
I can't open it!

00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:56.030
Open it!

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:57.820
What is this—?

00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:59.200
- What are you doing?
- I really will break the window!

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.360
What are you doing?

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:06.520
Hey, hey!

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:07.850
Open the door!

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:10.390
Open it now.

00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:12.550
- Open it.
- Open the door!

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:14.760
- Hurry and open it!
- Open the door!

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.690
No!

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.510
Unni, hurry!

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:21.070
Open the door!

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.280
No!

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.480
You!

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:30.540
Calm down, please!

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.650
What are you doing? Are you not coming in?

00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:35.060
You head in first!

00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:37.600
You!

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:41.740
Hey!

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:43.740
Stop it!

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:47.320
- Come here!
- Stop it!

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.600
Turn this off!

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.630
Calm down, please!

00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:53.500
You, come here!

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:02.990
This is all Mr. Oh Joo Hyung's doing.

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:19.510
What a waste.

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:23.650
It was a good chance. What a waste.

00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:25.800
But what's with your expression?

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.600
I didn't do anything. I did nothing wrong.

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.400
What's wrong?

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.460
Oh Joo Hyung!

00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:38.120
Did you at least bring my phone?

00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:44.750
What is it?

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.880
You bastard.

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.800
What, why, why?

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.980
What are you doing now?

00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:02.620
Are you crazy?

00:59:05.050 --> 00:59:08.080
This is blood from outside.

00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.080
Are you scared now?

00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:12.110
Are you scared now?

00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:14.970
You damned bastard!

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:22.140
Hyun! Hyun!

00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:44.380
As soon as the Internet starts working again, I'll become so famous.

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:26.310
Sorry.

01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:28.920
I overreacted, didn't I?

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:34.100
If it wasn't for you, everyone who went out would have been infected.

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:44.460
You did good, Hyun.

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.580
Take responsibility for the infected!

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.640
Take care, take care!

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.670
Take responsibility for the infected!

01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:08.850
Take responsibility, take responsibility!

01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:10.890
Take care of the quarantined!

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:13.060
Take care, take care!

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.910
Prove it, prove it!

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:19.120
Colonel, an infected person escaped from the apartment.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.530
He's showing symptoms. Should I bring him in?

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:24.640
[Quarantine without consent, is this our country?]
[Give us compensation!] [Don't forget the lease residents!]

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.380
- Let him go.
- I'm sorry?

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:28.990
Protect them, protect them!

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:34.320
Pretend you lost him and let him go for the protestors to see.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.160
Just make sure no one gets hurt and keep them in check.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.360
Colonel.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.590
We can't let them feel pity for the infected.

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:43.940
Just make them scared and want to avoid the infected.

01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:47.520
Then we can stall enough time to come up with an antibody.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.470
Go away, go away!

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:51.510
Take responsibility for the infected!

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:53.470
Take responsibility, take responsibility!

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:55.500
Protect the infected!

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.010
Protect them, protect them!

01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:02.530

The residents here... They're in a state of total anxiety.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.240
I... just want to buy it.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:33.480
Yes, that's it. We just have to change our thoughts a little and there are so many ideas.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.980
The situation will continue to get worse.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.010
We have to force him out. That's the only way we'll live.

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:41.260
- I purchased one.
- 15th floor.

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:43.930
Let's wait for the infected to die on their own.

01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:47.150
If you touched Sae Bom...

01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:49.330
You're dead.
