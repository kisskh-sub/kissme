=Episode 7=

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.430
You're still alive.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.790
I'm truly glad.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.260
You've recovered.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.760
I'm glad, too.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.710
People

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.350
sometimes having a dream

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.780
isn't a bad thing.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.200
All these years,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.000
I've imagined you living far away.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.760
It's just that you and I

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.070
would never meet again.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.180
We were just one step
from taking Huo Guang.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.480
Why did you back down?

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.800
Why would I ever back down?

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.150
It's just that I heard news at the time

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.240
that he'd sent troops to wipe you out.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.120
I offered to abdicate
if he would call off the attack.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.440
He agreed.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.360
He sent the order to retreat.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.330
But later, I heard that Wucheng Village

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.400
was awash in blood

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.500
and engulfed in fire.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.640
By then, it was all too late.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.080
When we arrived in Wucheng Village,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.030
Zhang Sheng was already there.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.610
As we stood our ground,

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.290
a group in Western Regions garb appeared.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.510
Everyone suddenly turned on each other.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.760
And I...

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.710
I somehow blacked out.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.560
What about my brothers then?

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.000
I truly had no idea.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.360
Only when I woke
did I learn His Majesty saved me.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.630
He did a good deed that day.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.570
Later, I heard you went to the Village

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.900
and even ran into danger.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.560
Thank heavens, you ended up safe.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.380
So...

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.770
It was you who summoned Lord Xu.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.090
And His Majesty.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.200
I spent years nursing my wounds

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.800
to repay him for saving my life.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.110
I even served as an official
in Chang'an for years.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.920
It was only right.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.380
So the scar on your neck...

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.210
Was from that time in Wucheng Village.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.100
This time I returned,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.090
not just because someone meant you harm.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.400
The Western Regions traders then...

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.270
I suspect they are tied to this.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.870
I must uncover the truth,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.430
set your mind at ease,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.720
and give our brothers of Changyi

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.090
the justice.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.120
I believe you.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.810
Come, give him the antidote.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.280
- Done.
- Next one.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.640
- That way.
- Open your mouth.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.300
Lock them all in prison.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.470
- Come.
- Gather for detox.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.270
In a safe refuge.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.330
Treat them well with food and drink.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.460
- Open your mouth.
- Move.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.600
I want to work.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.480
I want gold.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.150
See that they're cared for attentively.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.400
No mistakes are allowed.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.470
Understood.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.120
I want gold.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.360
I want to work.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.670
Rest assured.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.430
I'll handle workers' matters well.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.130
With you here,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.680
I feel at ease.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.320
Here's the list of poisoned workers.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.050
Ten days of detox treatment.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.290
Once their health improves,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.430
give each of them a comfort payment.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.000
That's very thorough of you.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.130
I'm not done yet.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.740
His... His...

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.700
His what?

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.170
- What?
- A letter from His Majesty.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.510
Heng, you've gone far away.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.020
I keep you close in my thoughts.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.840
Whenever state affairs grow heavy,

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.730
I long for you by my side

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.900
to offer counsel and strategy.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.350
May you return at the earliest time.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.780
Go back to your Chang'an.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.490
Someone misses you there.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.410
Marquis, that's just...

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.570
Childish.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.320
You…

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.100
(Haihun Marquis's Mansion)

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:12.980
What are you doing here?

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.190
You don't seem very polite.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.590
Can't I just drop by?

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.110
Wherever you go, I'll go with you.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.600
I'm going to sleep.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.460
Hey, Heng.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.840
Where are you going this late?

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.470
Haihun isn't like Chang'an.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.060
It's not safe at night.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.740
Childish.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.590
Ah.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.950
Why are you heading back?

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.410
Please.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.350
Go, go, go.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.740
(Are you there?)

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.700
(Yeah.)

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.580
(Come.)

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.860
(Yuzhang)

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.230
Heng, you look well this morning.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.040
Having breakfast all to yourself?

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.760
Heng.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.480
How's the pigeon soup? Tasty?

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.270
Not bad.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.820
Let me tell you something.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.000
This pigeon was quite nimble.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.080
It soared and wheeled in the sky,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.080
yet ended up as today's delicacy.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.640
It's like certain pieces of news,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.700
passed from one to another,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.230
and in the end,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.980
turning into a warm bowl of soup
like this,

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.040
right into my mouth.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.240
Liu He.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.310
Lord Wang, I finally found you.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.950
Imperial Guard Commander

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.525
of the Huben Army, Wang Heng,

00:08:56.526 --> 00:08:57.790
receive the imperial decree.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.710
Decree to the Imperial Guard Commander
Wang Heng.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.370
We hear Xiqiang has ended their feud

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.630
and now seek alliance to invade.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.880
This is a true threat at heart.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.450
If they join hands with the Xiongnu,

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.240
it may endanger the State.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.460
It troubles me greatly.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:11.560
Wang Heng,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.770
the post of Great General

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.960
remains open for you.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.280
Only veterans
like Zhao Chongguo can serve.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.240
Yet your skill is unmatched.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.030
I often recall you at my side as my aide

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.530
and feel deep gratitude.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.420
I long for your return.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.240
Hasten back to court

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.910
and share the burdens with me.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.640
Let us govern the realm together.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.600
I shall obey Your Majesty's will.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:36.840
Good soup.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.790
This longing, this yearning…

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.040
Such a heartfelt imperial decree…

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.720
Even as a bystander, it gives me chills.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.420
Lord Sun,

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.470
don't you find it a bit bittersweet?

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.520
Uh… we live rather close.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.370
Sending messages by pigeon

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.400
is far too much trouble.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.710
So I delivered

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.900
the imperial decree to you.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.870
No talk of pigeons.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.120
Come now, Lord Sun,

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.550
it's no trouble,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.750
not in the slightest.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.510
An hour is all it takes.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.150
Oh dear,

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.360
this imperial decree holds
perfect authority.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:19.810
You'd best head back.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.160
Let General Zhao go instead.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.030
General Zhao is already seventy.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.320
Rest assured.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.440
He can take them on.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.800
I'll reply to His Majesty.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.800
Alright, got it.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.400
Oh, by the way.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.700
Li Zhong has agreed to confess.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.240
He'll meet you alone,
with his medicine chest.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.480
Alright.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.600
You may go now.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.720
Yes.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.230
Uncle Li.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.160
I've brought you your medicine chest.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:12.750
Have a seat.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:27.790
This is

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.480
the antidote recipe for Mishenfu.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.910
The guards at the ancient tomb before,

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.150
including their leader, took this,

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.580
so they didn't get poisoned.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.390
You must keep it safe.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.270
Thank you, Uncle Li.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.360
I'll plead with the Marquis for you.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.270
Lately…

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.790
My head's been acting up again.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.060
Uncle Li.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.340
Why are you doing this?

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.880
Who ordered you to do it?

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.640
Uncle Li, Uncle Li!

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.940
My aim is precise.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.080
There's no saving me.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:23.050
I can only atone
to the Marquis with my life.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.920
If you ever see my son,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.620
give him the medicine chest.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:30.630
Go, quickly.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.670
Hurry, go.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.480
Haihun is no place for you.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.560
You can't...

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.840
escape...

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.100
those from the Western Regions…

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.480
So that means,

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.440
Li Qi is still alive.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.040
I don't know.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.990
I've already fallen to such a state,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.870
yet someone still wants me dead.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.860
Those from the west

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.790
tried to harm you
in Wucheng Village 11 years ago.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.410
My life's worth nothing now.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.050
What could they want?

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.370
They're after the Qilin spell.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.650
First, they got the Qilin
from the Huo Clan.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.990
After the fall of the Huo Clan,

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.020
I investigated the matter in Chang'an.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.560
In the end, I only seized
half the Qilin.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.080
And you?

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.120
Aren't you also after the other half?

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.240
Will you give it a rest?

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.210
Can I survive this calamity?

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.050
Of course you can.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.790
After that, how long will I have left?

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.030
Why would you ask that?

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.120
After going through all this,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.270
my body's not what it used to be.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.670
Just be straight with me.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.610
You'll live a long, blessed life.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:02.790
Really?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.580
Really.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.230
Look at those stars up there.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.550
They're linked into a shape.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.270
Doesn't it look like a lion?

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.920
That's your destiny star.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.320
Lion?

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.120
Looks more like an ox to me.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.940
It's more like a horse from here.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.780
And it's got chains all over it.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.360
Like it's bound.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.580
What chains?

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:29.540
It's clearly surrounded by stars.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.560
The starlight is dazzling.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.910
It means you'll have a long

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:34.900
and prosperous life.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.000
What kind of theory is that?

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.910
Astrology from the west.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.120
Star sign studies.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.690
Lord Wang, Marquis.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.220
Lord Sun, have you found anything?

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.910
I came precisely to report on this.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.550
These days, my colleagues and I

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:56.840
worked day and night,

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.200
neglecting sleep and meals,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.320
burning the midnight oil.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.620
Just tell me, did you or not?

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.550
We found nothing.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:05.840
You've worked hard, Lord Sun.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.360
It is merely my duty.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.440
I cannot turn away.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:11.630
Ah, Lord Sun.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.480
Physician Li served me for years.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.150
Though he made mistakes,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.870
I must trouble you still

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.440
to see to his burial with care.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.870
Rest assured, Marquis.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.230
I'll take care of it.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.450
Li Zhong's final words:

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.110
the enemy is strong

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.170
and hide in the dark.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.930
We don't know what dangers await us.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.410
The safest course

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.110
is to return to Chang'an with me.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.910
His Majesty summoned you.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.200
But I wish to go back with you.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:45.970
Yuzhang is dangerous right now.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.600
You're the Imperial Guard Commander,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.090
yet you're so timid.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.260
Here, take this.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.380
I can't give you the official seal.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.280
I simply think you're like that turtle,

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.220
always hiding your head.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.940
You're the one who's like a turtle.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.350
For the sake of your long life,

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.510
don't blame me.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.360
What are you doing?

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.070
Bookworm.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.360
How dare you seize me!

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.220
Yes, I'm seizing you. Now move.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.450
Move.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.320
Hyah!

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.400
Lord Wang, if you take the Marquis away,

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.000
how am I to explain this to His Majesty?
