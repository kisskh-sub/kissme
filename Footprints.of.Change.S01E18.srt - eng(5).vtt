[Episode 18]

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.460
Where has the scholar

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.300
gone to?

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.930
I've been looking for hours.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.240
I was wrong. Isn't that enough?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.460
You're just...

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:00.230
you...

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.750
What are all your names?

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.729
My name is Laifu.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.840
My name is Huhu.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.800
My name is Jixiang.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.930
My name is Longlong.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.520
My little brother is called Dabao.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.280
Why are these all boys' names?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.000
Ms. Yi,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.140
I'm sorry for the embarrassment.

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.060
My husband Arun

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.340
is an honest man

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.120
with no opinions of his own.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.030
He listens to my mother-in-law.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.280
My mother-in-law

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.440
won't stop until she gets a grandson.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.430
But

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.000
I had four girls one after another.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.390
When it came to the fifth child,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.870
I finally had a boy.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.150
My figure

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.079
has changed because of childbirth,

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.810
and it still hasn't recovered.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.280
It gave me all sorts of health problems.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.430
This is their

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.290
first time visiting the factory.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.210
Laifu,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.690
who told you to bring your siblings here?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.080
I'm sorry for the embarrassment, Ms. Yi.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.190
It's alright.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.310
Auntie has some fish-skin peanuts here.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.870
Here.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.080
Take these and share with your sisters.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.410
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.560
Thank you, Auntie.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.150
Thank you.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.000
Ms. Su,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.260
do you know why Qing and I argued?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.400
All the conflicts between Qing and me

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.030
are because of my identity.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.420
I am her sister-in-law

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.000
and also a martyr's family member.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.010
But no one considers that

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.680
beyond these identities,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.930
I am just myself.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.690
I have privacy that I don't want to share.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.190
Sometimes I just want to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.030
find a quiet corner to be alone.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.800
But everyone's

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.430
constant and overwhelming concern

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.400
makes me feel suffocated.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.630
It makes me feel exposed

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.320
and judged by everyone.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.000
Ms. Su,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.780
I'm not targeting you.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.050
I don't expect you to understand.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.520
I'm just talking.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.840
I do understand.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.840
The fact that you're sharing this with me

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.150
means a lot to me.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.310
You telling me about your situation

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.640
also touches me deeply.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.040
Auntie, I'm hungry.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.190
It'll be ready soon.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.750
Laifu is hungry too.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.250
Huhu is hungry too.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.600
Jixiang is hungry too.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.750
Dabao is hungry too.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.240
You all...

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.310
I don't have enough noodles here.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.159
How about this?

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.090
Let's go out to eat.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.850
My treat.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.560
Go out to eat?

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.790
Ms. Yi...

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.310
Thank you then.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.409
You're welcome. Let's go.

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:48.600
Come, give it to auntie.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.130
Let's go.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.390
Let's eat out.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.070
Come on.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.430
Time to go out for dinner.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.120
Let's go.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.070
It's raining so hard.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.510
Should we take shelter?

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.240
Let it pour. It's refreshing.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.190
Let's keep going.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.160
Give me back my hat.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.750
Here.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.310
Take it.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.400
Hurry.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.520
You're finally back.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.300
Where have you been?

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.040
I've been looking for you everywhere,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.920
all over the place.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.730
You.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.550
Look at you, you're soaking wet.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.480
Why are you still angry?

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.430
Alright.

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.960
Don't bother.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.750
You're running a fever.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.930
Change your clothes quickly.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.750
Come on, don't be angry.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.560
It's not a big deal.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.420
You're just...

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.560
Just go back.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.270
Let me tell you something.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.400
We've been partners

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.560
for over ten years.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.690
I finally figured it out on my way here.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.200
You never kept anything from me before.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.240
Even when you had an abscess in your ass,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.770
you were afraid of surgery.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.830
You told me first,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.030
not your wife.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.950
But now?

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.330
You're keeping secrets from me.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.750
You are hiding things from me.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.880
How many things are you hiding from me?

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.210
If you don't come clean with me,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.480
we're done for good.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.900
I have nothing to hide from you.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.750
Open the door.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:18.830
Just go away.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.510
Why did you lock the door? Open up!

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.120
I'll tell you everything.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.310
Just open the door!

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.240
Change your clothes first!

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.800
Stubborn fool.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.980
Yi,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.940
hurry,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.510
come with me.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.610
Come on, hurry up!

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.230
Secretary Zhao, what...

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.950
Sister,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.830
Sister, find the key to the second floor,

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:32.190
quickly!

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:32.600
Okay.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.270
Go now!

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.220
Secretary Zhao,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.800
why did you bring me here?

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.170
Wen is dying.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.870
Wen.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.640
Wen.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:55.950
Look who's here.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.950
Minister Wen.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.040
You're here.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.020
As soon as you arrived,

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.440
he came back to life.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.360
It's fine. You don't need to do anything.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.360
Just stay here.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.820
That's the best medicine.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:29.530
Yi,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.560
take good care of him.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.470
Don't leave.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.550
I won't.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.750
Sister.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:35.840
Coming.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.550
Sister.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:38.790
Who is it?

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.480
How is he? You took him to the hospital?

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.510
Hospital? No need.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.170
Why are you here, Sister Fang?

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.270
He's fine. He is in good hands.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.060
Good hands?

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.320
Who?

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.080
We can't let unreliable people walk in.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.540
Reliable, very reliable.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.720
What's not reliable about it?

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.180
They're both willing.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.080
Don't worry about it.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.670
Zhao Hangong, what are you thinking?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.080
They're not together anymore.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.270
Zhou introduced Yi Yi to someone.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.960
They're getting along well.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.600
I'm looking for someone suitable

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.440
for Wen.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.390
Why are you trying to push them together?

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.200
I'm not pushing them together.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.200
You really have nothing better to do.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.630
They both want this.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.790
Let's not worry about it.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.480
Besides...

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.740
you don't understand.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.080
What don't I understand?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.790
I introduced you to your wife!

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.360
That's true.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360
When you first met Jiang,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.390
you couldn't even speak.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.510
You kept running to the bathroom.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.840
And you say I don't understand?

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.750
Stop talking about my embarrassing past.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.600
Alright, Sister.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.840
Let's stop worrying about this, okay?

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.510
Be quiet.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.840
Is this just my personal business?

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:39.750
I...

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.530
Get out!

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.910
Sister.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.660
Save him some face.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.390
Sister.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:53.850
Come out.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.720
Come out.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.640
Zhao Hangong, go home.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.860
Close the door.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.960
Didn't I make myself clear the other day?

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.570
I told you to go home and think it over.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.460
You don't understand

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.750
what kind of man he is.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.370
You two are completely different.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.320
Although he used to be an intellectual,

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.840
he's been in the army for over ten years.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.440
He's been through blood and fire.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.270
He's not the bookish scholar you think.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.910
He was once a military commander.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.560
Do you understand what that means?

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.000
You don't understand at all.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.970
Have you thought about it?

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.170
Once you two are together,

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.120
what kind of life will you face?

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.120
Minister Wen is a leader.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.320
He will always prioritize his work.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.750
He can't give you romance.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.750
He can't give you poetry and art.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.000
And he can't satisfy your fantasies.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.500
This surely isn't the life you want.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.480
Then what kind of life do I want?

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.640
I certainly know.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.440
But I can tell you this.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.600
Minister Wen absolutely cannot give you.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.510
I've never expected anyone

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.060
to provide the life I want.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.340
How do you define your relation with him?

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.910
I respect Minister Wen.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.150
I enjoy talking with him.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.200
Even seeing him, hearing him speak

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.480
is a sophisticated pleasure.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.320
I won't depend on anyone.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.960
Nor do I ask for anything.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.150
I have my own life.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.510
I have my own work.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.540
Stop beating around the bush. Just say it.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.670
Do you want to form a family with him?

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.720
Fine.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.600
If you insist that I take a stand,

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.510
I'll tell you.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.270
I like Minister Wen.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.390
I want to live with him.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.120
I want to be with her.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.600
Okay.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:42.730
Alright.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.320
Okay, Wen Pu.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:46.790
Fine, Wen Pu.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.270
Then we'll follow the regulations.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.670
The organization must conduct

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.670
a thorough background check on her.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.360
Before the investigation results come out,

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.150
you two cannot meet.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.840
You're thinking too simply.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.520
I'm sorry for putting you through this.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.630
Don't be.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.390
It's good

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.420
like this.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.550
Please list all your social connections

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.080
since you turned eighteen,

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.360
including relatives, classmates

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.410
and colleagues.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.600
Write down clearly

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.870
their current occupations,

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:29.600
workplaces,

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.660
and other details.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.080
I lost touch with many people for long.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.000
You just need to provide the list.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.600
We'll investigate the rest.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.950
Minister Wen,

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.200
this is my self-criticism report.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.070
Minister Wen,

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.280
I've reflected seriously.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.780
I made a terrible mistake.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.030
My mistake was

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.680
not reading books or newspapers

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.310
and not understanding government policies.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.200
I'm still

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.640
stuck in old society ways

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.839
using methods from the Republican era.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.160
These old mindsets and outdated thinking

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.750
are hard to change overnight.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:13.869
But I had no ill intentions.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:15.680
Minister Wen, you know me well.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.859
Do I know you?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.640
Fu Zihe.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:22.270
Suppose I knew you before,

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:23.270
now

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.310
I understand you less and less.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.869
Minister Wen,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.349
I'm the kind of person

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.080
who just likes making friends.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.310
It's the same with Secretary Zhao.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:33.400
I just thought

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.440
friends could have meals together

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.900
and exchange small gifts.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.030
It's nothing.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.380
But now I understand

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.760
I was wrong.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.440
You worry about government policy changes,

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.350
and you also try to exploit loopholes to

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.720
corrupt officials and seek private gain.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.570
No, absolutely not.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.070
I suggest you

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.330
go back and

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.920
read more books, read more newspapers,

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.470
and study Central Government's directives.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:58.270
Yes.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.480
We won't forget those

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:01.690
who once helped us.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:03.480
But things

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.240
are always changing.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.600
Those who once walked with us

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.400
may gradually drift away.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.250
They become strangers,

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.160
or even

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.110
enemies.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.200
Minister Wen,

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.510
not enemies.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.290
We're friends, not enemies.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.080
Get up.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.590
Had enough of this act?

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:22.150
Yes.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:22.520
No,

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:23.330
not enough.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.910
No, no,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.880
I was wrong.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:25.790
I was wrong.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.440
Wrong. I was wrong.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.240
Wrong.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:32.320
Go home.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.740
Yes, Minister Wen.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.640
I'll definitely reflect when I get back.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.240
I'll study hard.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.070
I'll go now.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.530
[Self-criticism]

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.240
Your favorite cabbage

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.370
with sliced pork and amaranth.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.480
Here.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.810
Eat up.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.130
I know you don't want me and Minister Wen

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.240
being together.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.790
I also know why you

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.520
introduced Professor Xu to me.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.090
You allow me to find someone to live with.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.190
But you won't allow me to fall in love.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.400
Is that so?

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.080
Yes.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.570
Then according to you,

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.270
I can't have feelings for anyone again.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.130
Can I still call you Sis in the future?

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.510
Of course.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.360
Will you forget my brother?

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.630
How could I forget your brother?

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.810
He was my first love.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.270
You're all my family.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.550
Eat.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.070
Sis.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.640
I don't eat green onions.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.580
Then I'll pick them out for you.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.720
Sis,

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.270
you only ordered two steamed buns?

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.160
Hello,

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.530
add one more steamed bun.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.280
Make it three.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:41.940
Sure thing!

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:46.530
Eat up.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.770
Did you forget I don't eat green onions?

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.190
How could I remember all that?

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.640
But I remember yours.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.440
You don't eat cilantro.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.440
That was your brother.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:09.570
Thank you.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.550
Hello?

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:23.340
Wen Pu.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.720
Commander, it's me.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.830
What the hell are you doing?

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.310
How dare you speak so recklessly

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.200
in the interview with the Party newspaper?

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:30.970
Some things

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.730
can be said in private,

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.610
but not in public.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.490
You're a sophisticated political officer.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:38.960
Don't you understand this?

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.760
I don't understand, Commander.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.350
What happened?

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:43.860
In the Party newspaper interview,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.190
you went on about Western Puritan ideals.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.880
What's all this about worldly asceticism?.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.280
Our Party advocates frugality,

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.420
integrity,

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.760
and selflessness.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.310
[To Comrade Wen Pu]

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.310
All that nonsense you talked about,

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.270
once published,

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.930
what will the people think?

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.000
I remember now.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.550
Well,

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.180
they did interview me.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.210
But they should

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.810
send me the draft for review.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.350
The comrades at the newspaper said

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.150
they already sent you the draft.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.560
You weren't there.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.040
Fang said you were sick.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.110
What convenient timing to be ill.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.660
Li was going to send it,

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:20.790
but according to procedure,

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:21.760
it was first submitted to

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.180
the Municipal Propaganda Department.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.930
That's when they said that some content

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.590
hadn't been confirmed by you.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.620
I understand, Commander.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.000
Perhaps during the interview,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.440
Yang and I didn't understand each other.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:36.510
If you haven't thought it through,

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.970
don't communicate at all.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.640
The responsibility for this matter

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.770
still lies with you.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.050
I understand, Commander.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.750
Scholar, let me tell you.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.480
Yang Xue'an

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.050
is full of dirty tricks.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.350
I just don't understand.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:11.750
We all came from the same trench.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.690
Why is he always up to no good?

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:14.830
Even if

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.220
he saved the political commissar's life,

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:20.520
he can't just do whatever he wants.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.510
Don't be angry.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.160
I'll handle this.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.680
I'll teach him a lesson.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.920
You'll teach him a lesson?

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.750
How exactly?

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.790
I'll beat him up.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.440
Come on.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.080
I knew you'd say that.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.800
Will beating him up help?

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.800
It might just lead to another article.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.510
The headline would be:

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.880
Party Secretary Zhao Hangong

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.510
stands up for Minister Wen Pu

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.120
and brutally beats reporter Yang Xue'an.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.350
Wouldn't that just complicate things?

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.000
Right?

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.440
He's not our enemy.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.350
You have a point.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.510
What do you want to do then?

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:56.790
Just swallow this insult?

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.520
I'm not swallowing any insult.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.920
I know him.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.560
If he doesn't change his ways

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.320
and continues like this,

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.630
I believe he won't go far.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.950
Alright, you fool.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.640
Let time take care of this.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.360
Come, let's drink.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.240
Fine.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.390
I'll listen to you this time.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.150
If Yang Xue'an does it again,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.480
I'll beat him up

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.070
even if I make a headline.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.750
Good.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.840
I agree.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.000
Secretary Zhao,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.930
who are you planning to beat up now?

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.570
For the past decade or so,

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.570
all we hear is you

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.720
beating someone up.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.120
As the old saying goes,

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.360
heaven sees what you do.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.120
How should I address you?

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.890
Comrade is clearly not appropriate.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.070
Ms.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.960
or Madam

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.590
sounds too formal.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.550
Let me just call you Yi.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.750
It sounds like a tagalong.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.080
That is completely unlike you.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.400
This morning,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.930
I watched the sky from the balcony.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.550
The dawn colors were unusual.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.870
There are pink

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.240
and purple.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.490
Neither was bright,

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.750
as if washed with water.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.200
It reminded me of

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.200
you painting by the river.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.810
Your colors, compared to reality,

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.750
were always a bit lighter.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.760
I didn't quite understand then.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.200
This morning,

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.950
standing on the balcony,

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.510
watching the clouds gradually fade,

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.640
I suddenly somewhat

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.280
understood the artistic realm you pursue.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.030
Okay, thank you.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:55.990
Minister.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.210
I'll head out first.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.410
Okay.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.110
Comrade Zhou,

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.790
let's find some time

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.140
to visit your brother's grave

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.500
together with your sister-in-law.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.790
Zhaoyuan was a revolutionary martyr.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.230
He lost his life for liberation.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.400
I remember the Central Committee

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.150
sent a congratulatory telegram

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.480
for Shanghai's liberation, ending with:

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.700
The revolutionary martyrs

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.830
who sacrificed their lives for

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.070
Shanghai's liberation will live forever.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.940
We will never forget him,

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.020
and neither will the people.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.680
Minister,

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.700
you must treat my sister-in-law well,

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.800
treat my sister well.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.510
Your biological father's surname is Lin.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.570
Why did you change your surname to Yi?

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:35.350
I was born into a feudal family.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.110
My father was corrupt

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.590
and backward.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.640
You have an aunt.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.610
Are you still in touch with her?

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:49.790
[1949]

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.390
My aunt and uncle went abroad

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.530
for business before the Liberation.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.400
Their address changes frequently.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.440
I've received a few letters from them,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.650
but couldn't reply.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.140
We haven't been in contact recently.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.270
Auntie, are you really leaving?

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:19.400
Your uncle has been urging me to go.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.770
But I must settle things at the hospital.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.920
If I don't leave soon,

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.230
my ticket will expire.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.040
You're going to such a faraway country.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.390
Are you not coming back?

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.810
It's hard to say.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.070
At least in the near future,

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.490
I won't be coming back.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.400
Auntie,

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.510
you've put so much effort

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.160
into building this obstetric hospital,

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.670
and now you're just leaving.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:41.730
Don't you feel sad?

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.960
Of course I do.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.070
Then why?

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.270
Some things

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.150
are difficult to explain to you.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:00.730
Yi,

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.450
perhaps we'll

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.030
see each other again.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.350
This watch

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.330
is given to you now.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.420
I hope it brings you luck.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.280
When you miss me,

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.070
just look at it.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.830
You should be aware

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.680
that foreign connections are sensitive.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.410
You must report to us promptly.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:51.630
I understand.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:52.940
When you were at

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.440
Shude Girls' School in Chongqing,

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.350
who were you close to?

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.580
Liu Zhuyun,

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.750
Huang Yiling and Gao Qiongqiong

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.010
were quite close to me.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.510
But they all married and moved far away,

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.830
and we lost contact after the liberation.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:05.830
What about Qiao Xiaolan?

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.960
Qiao Xiaolan and I weren't that close.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.480
She didn't go to college

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.720
after high school.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.930
She also married and moved away.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.180
Since 1945,

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.590
Qiao Xiaolan

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.880
worked in the KMT's Central

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.200
Investigation Department in Chongqing.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.200
Did you know that?

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:24.970
No, I didn't.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.710
Qiao Xiaolan claims

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.880
that she has contact with you all along.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.070
Between 1949 and 1952,

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.310
she says you and she were in Shanghai

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:35.790
and lived together.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.240
She's lying.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.440
I can confront her face to face.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.840
So cute.

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:57.700
Mr. Yang, did you like playing soccer

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.830
when you were young?

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.730
I didn't have time to play soccer.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.230
When I was his age,

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:04.430
I could already write the

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:06.090
Thousand Character Classic.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:09.820
Xue'an,

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.140
I want to talk to you about something.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:13.670
Go ahead.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.650
Don't get angry when I tell you.

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:17.640
Why would I get angry about it?

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.110
Speak.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.820
It's about my sister-in-law.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.950
Well then,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.550
I have even less reason to be angry,

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.110
right?

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.790
Look.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.000
Yi Yi,

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.950
is someone we're helping,

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.710
and your sister-in-law.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880
Both officially and personally,

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.960
I shouldn't get angry.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.640
Go on.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.370
I'm really going to say it now.

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:36.070
Don't get angry.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.640
I won't get angry.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.920
After you finish, I'll buy you a popsicle.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.050
Alright, here goes.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.790
I think

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.480
my sister-in-law and Minister Wen

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.610
are actually quite good together.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.440
I'm starting to change my thinking.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.240
Maybe my previous perspective

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.590
was too narrow.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.350
See, you're angry.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:01.470
How am I angry?

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.250
Then why are you glaring at me?

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:04.420
I...

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.240
glared at you?

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.200
I...

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:08.480
Glare?

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.480
Did I glare at you?

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:10.070
Yes.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.500
Continue.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.720
They truly love each other

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.050
and respect each other.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.320
Look, even

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.240
Director Fang

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.070
can't keep them apart.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.480
My attitude is why not let them try.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.030
Try?

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:26.460
Try what?

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:28.950
Comrade Zhou Yunqing,

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.610
how could you think like this?

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.270
What's Yi Yi's background?

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.790
She's petty bourgeois.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.580
She needs to improve herself.

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:38.910
She needs

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.550
to change her way of doing things

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.790
to integrate with the people,

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.580
not thinking about vanity all day

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.380
and climbing up to Minister Wen.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.890
Your unstable position is one thing, but

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.630
Minister is an old revolutionary comrade.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.030
How could he be like this?

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.790
What kind of thinking is this?

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:54.880
This is dangerous.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.030
Today,

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.520
I'm clearly telling you right here that

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.210
they cannot be together.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.710
It's dangerous for them to be like this.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.020
Now that I've talked about them,

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.220
let me talk about you.

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:11.110
Comrade Zhou Yunqing,

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.060
your position

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.610
is too unstable now.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:14.560
You've changed.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:16.170
I don't know you anymore.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.650
You used to be

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.760
a simple girl.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.240
I admired that.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:22.240
And now?

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.410
How could you do this?

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.810
You've become a two-faced hypocrite,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.220
a fence-sitter,

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:29.720
bending whichever way the wind blows.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.780
Why are you crying?

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:31.630
You...

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.030
you start crying?

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:33.630
Not only is

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.850
your position inconsistent,

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.650
but your willpower is also weak.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.330
Your behavior today

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.400
has completely

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.330
ruined this pleasant atmosphere.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:42.550
Such a blue sky.

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:43.390
Such

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.810
tall trees.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:45.850
Isn't it

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.650
heartbreaking?

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.590
You...

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:57.240
if you cry like this,

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.110
you'll scare kids.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.610
You said you wouldn't get angry,

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.110
so I spoke up.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:04.690
Am I angry?

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:08.880
You...

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.179
don't want popsicles?

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.469
I'll buy it myself.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.500
The people and environment around me

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:23.630
all require me

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.900
to put in great effort to change them.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.850
It's truly heartbreaking.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.670
I know

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.720
we can't meet in private.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.320
Just two minutes, okay?

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:55.310
Be careful.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:00.510
Where's your bicycle?

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:01.400
My bi...

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.240
My bicycle!

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:04.380
Well...

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:04.960
you...

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:06.590
I'm fine. You go ahead.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:07.780
Then I'll...

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.030
Run quickly. Don't lose it.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.190
Let's go back to our previous question.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.450
What's your relation with Qiao Xiaolan?

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.240
We were classmates at Shude Girls' School.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:33.640
We have no relation.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:35.230
After the liberation, are you sure

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.280
you haven't contacted her again?

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:38.280
No,

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:39.850
not even once.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.790
Come in.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.400
Qiao Xiaolan is here.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.110
Let her in.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.330
She's not Qiao Xiaolan.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:57.320
Qiao Xiaolan,

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.180
do you know this woman?

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.240
No,

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:05.840
I've never seen her before.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.470
During your investigation, you stated

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:08.610
you graduated from

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:09.790
Chongqing Shude Girls' School

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:10.990
and had close contact

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.380
with a female classmate who married

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.550
a high-ranking KMT official surnamed Yi.

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:15.510
Madam, I didn't go to

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.480
Chongqing Shude Girls' School.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.840
I attended Jinan Shude Girls' School.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.880
How can this be?

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.360
Then what's the name

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.510
of your classmate with the surname Yi?

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:24.110
She

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.320
actually doesn't have the surname Yi.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.120
She took her husband's surname.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.150
Her maiden name is Hu.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.650
Well, here's the thing.

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.570
Your political background check

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:42.570
have results now.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.970
Everything is fine.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.600
Thank you, Director Fang.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.720
If there's nothing else,

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.770
I'll be going now.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.320
Wait.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.690
I'm not finished yet.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.670
Although you may not want to hear this,

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.630
there are some things I must say.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.400
Do you know

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.960
what Minister Wen's job

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.320
actually entails?

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.150
The special nature of his work is that

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.440
he must deal with three forces

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.590
to negotiate,

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:27.510
balance,

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.210
and interact with them.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.140
We live in peaceful times now.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.950
Our enemies are often invisible.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.810
Do you know how many people are watching,

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.080
waiting for us

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:39.190
to make mistakes,

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.590
to show weaknesses

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.630
and

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:43.070
commit errors?

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.480
But now that he's with you,

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.400
these uncertainties have multiplied.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.680
What you must bear

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.600
is not just your personal fate,

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.070
but also Minister Wen's

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:58.750
political career.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.360
You're thinking too simply.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:08.590
Go back and think it over.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:48.760
How is it?

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.110
Ms. Fang told you, right?

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.480
Your political background check passed.

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.210
Is what we're doing

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.460
really right?

00:39:58.070 --> 00:39:59.270
What's wrong with it?

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.880
What did

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.480
Ms. Fang tell you?

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.000
You're a veteran revolutionary,

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.770
a high-ranking leader.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.400
Now you have me,

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.670
an uncertain factor,

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.360
a major weakness.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.480
I'm just an ordinary person.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:17.960
I can't bear the weight of your

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.630
grand political destiny.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.800
Ms. Fang told you this.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:26.410
She wasn't trying to make it hard for you.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.670
She doesn't know you.

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:32.030
She doesn't know how independent you are,

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.490
how strong you are inside.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.150
Besides,

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.470
how could you possibly be my weakness?

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:41.880
Having you by my side

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.880
is like having a mirror

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.810
that shows me sincerity

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.280
and the human heart.
