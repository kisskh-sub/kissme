[Episode 9]

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.160
The building representative Ahjumma took Ahjussi Jung Gook with her earlier.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.060
Both of them looked weird...

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.390
Hi.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.470
Ahjussi.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.210
Oh, hi.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.880
Are you thirsty, too?

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.150
Don't even think about messing with the child.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.820
Tell me if you have something to say.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.420
You, too, Ahjussi.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.620
Sae Bom, we still need to find the infected.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.860
You could catch the disease without knowing.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.730
Detective, stand straight! We're trying to keep order.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.150
There is a lot of food and drinks in this house.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.980
We'll just stay in the house

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.420
so please stop this and leave now.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.300
Right this minute.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.790
The last ounce of my patience is running out.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.520
Look at her glaring at me.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.150
What are you doing? Aim your gun!

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.150
He really is a lunatic.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.020
Hey. What are you looking for?

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.950
What should I get you?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.420
Well, I just...

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.600
It doesn't feel like a newlywed's home.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.140
It does when you're not here.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.590
But that girl...

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.240
You shouldn't keep her here, should you? What if you two bite her?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.930
Then where should she go? To your house?

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.700
She could.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.560
I'm a good babysitter.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.100
I can tutor her, too.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.660
You came to look for the drug, didn't you?

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.940
The one that causes Madman Rabies.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.560
Give me that and hide in here as though you're dead.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.330
Then I'll let you live here.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.520
What will you do with that anyway?

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.600
When you failed to infect the residents and put on a show?

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.930
I've been thinking...

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.390
My wife stayed alive after taking that drug, even though her head was smashed in.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.690
If it becomes dangerous, I was planning to take that drug, too.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.990
I wouldn't die from excessive bleeding by getting bitten by those monsters.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.250
I can get the disease without any pain.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.660
Aren't you scared of the disease?

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.790
So what if I catch the disease?

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.520
You end up not fearing anything.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.870
Ahjussi, this isn't a narcotic.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.160
What?

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.140
What are you doing over there?

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.190
Weren't you on the third floor?

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.020
I got permission from the detective in unit 501 and moved in there.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.220
But is something going on?

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.080
Oh, I heard that the people across the hallway are infected.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.090
They didn't attack or try to bite you?

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.900
No. They never did that.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.720
Honey, are you sure they're infected?

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.190
You're responsible for everything that happens from now on.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.860
All right. Everyone who is here, let's gather around and talk for a second.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.020
I think we need to discuss the follow-up measures for the people in unit 501.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.060
Everyone!

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.680
Have your meeting in the Building Representative's house.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.430
Her house is empty and has nothing inside!

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.430
Even if all of you here go into your apartment,

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.530
there will be plenty of space, right?

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.990
Detective!

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.190
Hey, Sae Bom. Why are you doing this?

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.930
Sae Bom, breathe.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.700
Calm down.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.390
Okay.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.530
Everyone, go home.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.230
Let's go home.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.670
[SY Cleaning]

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.270
Sae Bom.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.410
Are you okay?

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.130
Are you not thirsty?

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.090
I'm so disappointed in you, Ahjussi.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.770
That's true. Building Representative's house sounds good.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.600
We can look around the Royal floor while we're at it.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.770
That's right. Unit 201 is too shabby for all these VIPs to come over.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.570
I haven't cleaned up my place yet.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.840
I'm fine even if it's not all that clean.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.730
The Building Representative's apartment, that sounds good. Let's go there.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.100
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.030
Let's go. Go, go.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.370
Let's go.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.840
Are you okay?

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.360
Hey, would I ever want Sae Bom to be infected?

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.160
I'm just worried. You saw it, too. The wound on Sae Bom 's hand.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.560
That's really nothing, Hyung. It's just a scar.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.230
You're worried for nothing.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.630
Hyun, go ahead inside first.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.030
I'll take responsibility and guard your place.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.630
If nothing happens even after a few days,

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.730
those people will be relieved, I'm sure.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.870
Hyung, be careful.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.460
Those people can't be trusted.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.070
This is so far. It's so far.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.560
Exactly. Living on the Royal floor isn't all good.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.970
I always sacrificed myself by coming down.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.610
Next time, let's talk downstairs.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.060
Wow, you have nothing here.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.530
Are you sure you really live here?

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.610
In any case, it will cost you a bit for cleaning service.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.780
Pastor, how come you drink so much?

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.240
More than that, what should we do with the infected?

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.640
You saw Yoon Sae Bom's attitude, right?

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.950
At this rate, they might barge in here all of a sudden.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.830
Remember what the attorney from unit 602 told us about the emergency evacuation?

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.170
But I don't see him today.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.720
I'll tell him.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.880
To apply that article you mentioned,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.360
that is their home, and it's not like they show symptoms.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.890
That's right. It's not like they've hurt anyone yet.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:04.700
All right. I have proof that the policewoman on the fifth floor is infected.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.950
It might be better to kick them out of their apartment.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:13.360
People become strangely bold when there is no support.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.770
Do you know how infected show symptoms when they drink water?

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.880
Wouldn't it be more dangerous to leave all that water there?

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.840
That's true. They had a lot of water.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.990
We can't just dump it out.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.220
I'm sure everyone is struggling with the prolonged lockdown.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.310
Let's have all the residents divide them equally.

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:37.560
Gosh, seriously...

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.000
I think everyone is so mean.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.140
But they're not bad people.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.880
It's because people get scared.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.060
- Even the Ahjussi from unit 601?
- Except for him.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.870
Don't even go next to him or reply if he talks to you.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.430
Just ignore him like he's not even there. Got it?

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.740
- Don't even look at him.
- Yes.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.180
But isn't Ahjussi Jung Gook too much?

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.230
We have known him for over ten years.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.220
I'm not siding with him, but...

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.730
he hasn't gone home in a while.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.690
He must miss his wife so much. I'm sure he's worried about her, too.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.900
You know that I keep a score, right?

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.010
Plus one for a good deed. Minus one for a bad deed.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.330
Ahjussi Jung Gook is in the minus right now.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.800
Just score me. I must have lots of points.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.910
I am in the plus, right?

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.230
Detective went up.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.560
Went up to where?

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.200
The people upstairs are plotting to kick you two out.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.010
When I told him that, he went upstairs.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.420
- Kick us out to where?
- Outside.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.300
They're saying they'll take away your food and water, too.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.790
Stay here with Seo Yoon.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.470
Bom! Yoon Sae Bom, don't get worked up!

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.000
Are you worried?

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.930
Not for Sae Bom. The people.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.350
They're civil servants. If they bite people,

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.500
they'll lose their apartment. You know that.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.530
Sae Bom was so happy to get an apartment.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.240
You all live in the same apartment building. I don't know why you're doing this.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.840
Hey, Sae Bom, why did you come here?

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.390
I'll explain everything to them. Go home.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.780
Detective, what are you doing? That woman is holding a knife!

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.410
What were you all talking about?

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.890
Detective!

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.210
What are you doing?

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.260
What? Are you going to shoot me?

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.010
Are you going to shoot everyone and kill us all?

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.530
Hey, Sae Bom, calm down.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.490
It's okay, it's okay. Leave her alone.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.010
She's not brave enough to shoot. Go ahead and shoot!

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.990
The police leave the first chamber empty.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.060
What will you do now?

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:53.230
Will you threaten us and live here when you're infected?

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.630
I came here because I was pissed.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:03.280
Since we're all here, should we look for infected people?

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.880
Do you have a way?

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.380
You all know that infected people get thirsty.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.040
When they hold back their thirst and hide their infection,

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.430
what would happen if they saw human blood?

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.760
Where is blood?

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.160
Here.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.810
Damn it!

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.650
It's okay.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.890
Damn...

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.830
Oh no!

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:43.690
[Happiness]

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.380
She quieted down a moment ago.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.290
What do we do now?

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.900
We should wait for now until communication is possible.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:15.580
Since Ahjussi Jung Gook is here, let's go up and get you treated.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.340
It will be tough for Bo Ram, too, if she smells blood.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.030
Ahjussi, stay here for a while.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.100
Geez...

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.470
We have to find out if she was bitten or took the drug.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:39.160
I got it. I'll ask her.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.920
Hey.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.830
Let's hurry.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.720
It will be bad if you get a bacterial infection.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.330
Calm down.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.440
I may not look like it, but I have a strong immune system.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:57.150
Hey. Lee Bo Ram is moving.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.080
I'll go up alone. Go in.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.740
I know how to do simple first aid.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.300
I just have to stop the bleeding, right?

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.670
Put the medicine on and put on a new towel.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:14.420
Put your hand above your head and lie still.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.510
Give me some water, too.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.750
Gosh, I was so scared.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.130
Am I holding your water for you?

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.190
Everyone, leave now.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.560
We're in no mood to have a discussion anymore.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.000
Honey, let's go.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.120
- You're all still here.
- Why?

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.090
You can't just leave.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.540
- After Sae Bom went through all that.
- Geez!

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.900
We should look for the infected to the end.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.130
We don't know if you're infected, Oh Joo Hyung.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.970
Isn't that right?

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.460
You too, Building Representative.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.400
I'm coming in.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.930
Hurry and leave.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.920
I might change again.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.600
You can relax. Your episode just ended.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.120
You won't turn for a while.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.740
I came to say something important.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.800
I have to know where you got infected

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.360
so we can prepare.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:05.690
Did you maybe take drugs at the gym?

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.170
I got infected at the supermarket.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:14.610
When I hid away from the infected, I must've been scratched.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:28.360
I was afraid you wouldn't let me in the building if I told you.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.490
I got scared.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.120
No one will come here

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.200
so get some rest.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.300
Thank you.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:45.450
If it weren't for you, I would've bitten someone.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.530
You don't know that.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:54.040
You could've held yourself back to the end without biting anyone.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.720
At the emergency stairwell... Did you throw away bloodied towel?

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.060
In a trash bag?

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.560
No. That wasn't me.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.800
Why? Is something there?

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.230
[Do Not Enter, Chance of Infection]

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:23.170
I heard noises outside.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.260
From the golf range.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.400
Isn't Na Soo Min there?

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:49.490
You just have to say that you think the fifth-floor woman is infected, too.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.810
- Why?
- I think I hear something from over there.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:59.170
Who would come down here when there's an infected?

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.800
Oh, do you play some golf, my brother?

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.970
Well, just the screen golf. Not too often.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.880
I see. Then you can practice comfortably here.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.330
You'll leave here as a single player.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:32.180
You have to return home safely when the treatment becomes available.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:37.230
If people find out you had Madman Rabies, would your family be happy about it?

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.190
Are you worried about the woman on the fifth floor?

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.480
Because she was in the Special Operation Unit?

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.670
I was in the military, too. KATUSA.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.280
Even in the States, I was in the National Guard in Kentucky.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.980
I can tell right away. That woman is a nobody.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.740
Are you sure?

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.050
Are you sure you were in the military?

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.190
I was a military serviceman.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.150
Go home. Your wife must be in shock.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.250
Oh, yes.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.150
Okay.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.390
Leave the golf club here.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.660
Okay.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.970
When you return home, tell others what's going on and be careful.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.310
When you meet someone, meet as a group.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.190
Okay.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.330
Thanks for all your efforts.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.440
Oh Joo Hyung, continue to be careful so you don't become infected.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.420
Don't worry. I'm always careful.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.860
Change your pants when you go home.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.270
It looks wet.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.180
Please go now. I want to be alone.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.620
Building Representative, you should stay home for now, too.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.310
It could be an incubation period.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.980
What the hell?

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.060
What the hell is going on, well?

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.760
Honey!

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.210
What's going on here?

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.070
What are you doing?

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.460
There is blood here.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.630
The fifth-floor couple was behaving crazy.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.160
I have to gather the residents again.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.460
This time, we will make sure to get rid of the infected who are inside.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.170
Where did you go?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.120
You promised to be home.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.450
I did. While putting my hand above my head and lying down.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:09.470
But I had a better idea while coming up.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.640
How good of an idea was it?

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.720
Listen up.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.320
Since I'm bleeding anyway,

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.720
wouldn't it be nice to find more infected...

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.570
So did you find infected people?

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.820
No.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.760
Well, it's a good thing.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.720
But this isn't good.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.010
You can put some medicine on for me.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.540
It will heal in no time. Let's go in.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.520
What are you doing over there?

00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:59.700
Yes...

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.630
I'm too ashamed to face you guys.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:07.030
I'm gullible so I made you suffer...

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:11.300
I will just stay on the second floor or the gym.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.180
I can't face Seo Yoon, either.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.430
It's okay. Hurry and come.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.830
I have to treat Hyun's cut.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.460
Ahjussi.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.700
Stay strong.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.660
Tell us if you're worried going forward.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.680
And don't betray us.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.670
Betray... It's my first time...

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.320
Geez.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:49.660
Let's go in.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.410
Oh, okay. Thanks.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.060
Hey...

00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.120
I'll be good. Really.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.510
Hurry and come. Let's go in.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.050
Ahjussi, did you get hurt a lot?

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:22.180
No, it's just a scratch.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.170
It's not because of an infected person, but a knife.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:28.230
- Wait, Seo Yoon.
- Not someone else. I did it.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:31.380
She has to treat him. Let's stay out.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.780
I cut my—

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.270
- Let's go.
- Sit down.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.030
How can you...

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.900
when you look perfectly normal...

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.180
cause trouble all of a sudden?

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.160
I had to! How could I just watch you cut your hand?

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.360
Should I compliment you by saying how nicely you cut yourself?

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.000
You and I are different.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.120
I cut a little bit. Only a few drops of blood.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.900
You only had to scare them, but you created a puddle of blood.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.120
It's because I'm a passionate person.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.660
I'm just bleeding. My vessels and tendons are fine. Look.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.040
Do I look that stupid?

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.370
Right?

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.270
I'm fine, right?

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.600
No?

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.710
Can't I use my hand now?

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:49.090
We won't have to stitch it up.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.340
Don't do this again. It makes me feel bad to see you get hurt.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.810
My stomach feels uncomfortable, and I don't think I can eat dinner.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.290
I feel the same.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.190
When all those people were glaring at you,

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.230
and you held a knife, trying to cut your hand.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:11.250
- How can I stay put?
- How about me?

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.250
This is okay for me, but you shouldn't do that.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.780
- Why not?
- Just don't if I tell you not to.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:22.530
Crybaby.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:30.560
♫ Than sadness and sorrow ♫

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.190
[D+2]

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.700
- I thought she was infected. Why is she still there?
- Be quiet!

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.270
You said she was infected. You said so.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.780
That woman is tied up, right?

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.840
Please get out for a moment.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.060
I'll take her. You wrap up here.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.800
Oh...

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.790
Geez...

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.890
Where do you want to go? The indoor golf range is empty, too.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:32.250
I feel stuffy.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.760
Somewhere with an open space.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.230
All right.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.010
I see that everyone who should be here came.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:51.570
The 15th-floor guy has never come, and grandpa's family on the third floor

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.390
said they would stay home.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.760
The pastor isn't here.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.540
He's not feeling well so he wanted to rest at home.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.790
Make sure you check him to see he's not infected.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.990
What did you say?

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.360
Gosh, come on. Please calm down.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.880
The cleaning lady isn't here, either.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.280
By chance, is she at your apartment?

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.300
No, she didn't come to my place.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.780
Did she go to the basement?

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.680
You said there's a staff break room in the basement, right?

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.160
Let's not drag this out and track them down.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.420
I heard they go crazy when they see blood.

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.690
I'm not infected. Really.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.670
Detective, please speed it along.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:32.590
- Bring me a cup.
- Okay.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.430
Then...

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:38.790
the attorney can do it himself.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.620
Here is a knife.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.670
Fill it up halfway. Just like how you fill it up for a urine test.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.090
Police should do stuff like that.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:50.800
You have a cut already anyway.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.270
Yes, indeed.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.040
Should I open up the wound again?

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.290
The police aren't blood donors. Whoever wants to do it, go ahead.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.360
Here.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.820
No one?

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.840
Oh!

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.940
Is this enough?

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.680
Hurry and stop the bleeding.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.700
Does everyone feel better now?

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:31.720
Here.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:36.590
If an infected is among us,

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:40.400
there should be an inkling, right?

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.930
Gosh, seriously.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.770
Come here.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.490
Be careful. Careful!

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.340
Look at it straight.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.390
You're okay, right?

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:08.950
Yes.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:14.120
Then no one is infected among us, right?

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.600
No.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.470
Then let's talk about food now.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:21.970
Second-floor people, are you trying to get rich with this?

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.120
You were asking for a crazy amount of money.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.570
What do you mean it's crazy?

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.370
Supply and demand. Don't you know capitalism?

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.990
When you live in such a nice building, don't you have at least that much money?

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.410
You're speaking so casually. Why are you speaking informally?

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.060
Who spoke informally?

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.850
You just did! And besides...

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:41.660
what do you know about capitalism?

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.660
A new mutation was found among the critically ill.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.810
What is different?

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:49.580
They can control the timing of their episodes.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:53.630
They can usually suppress the thirst, and only when they're sure they won't get caught,

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:55.570
they have an episode.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.320
It's such a conniving disease. It's as bad as people.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.370
The superior command is asking for follow-up measures.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:05.460
But it's tough to capture an infected with the mutation.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.500
How is he doing?

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.440
I injected a tranquilizer cocktail.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.260
He'll stay normal for ten minutes,

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.360
but it's highly likely that he won't recover again.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.380
Ten minutes will do it.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.200
How have you been?

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:35.640
I'm late because I had too much to do, thanks to you, Chairman.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.680
Your funeral went well.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.590
Some people cried when they heard that you volunteered for clinical trials.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.760
When the situation is resolved,

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.690
you'll probably receive a national medal of recognition.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.220
Your children were crying a lot.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.230
You didn't tell them your slush fund account number, right?

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.520
Do you think it will end like this?

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.240
Of course, it won't end like this. We have lots of experiments to run.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.070
The higher-ups are pushing off all the

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.050
messy decisions on you, right?

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:18.600
Do you think you'll become big if you stand ground until the treatment becomes available?

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.840
That won't happen.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.920
When the hunt is over, a hunting dog is no longer necessary.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.000
Your wife and your child...

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.700
They'll become like me.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:47.720
Only five minutes remain for you to speak normally.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:50.920
A hunting dog?

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:57.250
When I obtain the treatment,

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.200
who will be treated like a hunting dog?

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.210
How is Yoon Sae Bom's blood analysis?

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.770
The results will be available as early as tomorrow.

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:09.990
You said it's tough to capture a critically ill with the mutation, right?

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:12.700
Yes, they hide their thirst well, and

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.450
it's impossible to tell just by looking at them.

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:20.170
It's not like we can keep the infected together until they develop a mutation.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:22.470
Seyang Forest...

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.310
There are many critically ill people gathered there.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.250
It's been ten days since the apartment was put in lockdown.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.400
Then mutation must have occurred by now.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.880
Is that why you insisted on the lockdown?

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.760
To trace the virus's mutation?

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.400
We have to find out how the virus mutates in a natural setting.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:53.900
It's like a Petrie dish with germs.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.170
You must've determined that if we're lucky,

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.610
we could also get antibodies.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.430
Crack open the door of the apartment building. Just enough for one person to leave.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:05.690
Then the infected people will come out on their own.

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:07.960
Capture them and proceed with the research.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:26.310
You told your husband that you're coming over, right?

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.590
I have a favor to ask you.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.910
You have some survival gear for the outdoors, right?

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.940
And could you share some water and food, too?

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.520
It's not for me. Someone is staying...

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.380
on the rooftop.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.860
Stay here for now.

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.240
I'll block all the doors downstairs.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.110
Thank you so much.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:55.820
I brought you some water and food.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.020
[Unit 1501 Kim Se Hoon]

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.470
I'll bring some from my home, too.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:02.400
Don't bring any water.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.450
I get thirstier the more I drink.

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.620
It's better to just wet my lips.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:13.160
The ice box... You didn't drink water then, either, right?

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:24.120
- No.
- Who else didn't drink water then?

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:27.800
I gave you just a little bit of water on purpose.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.350
Drink just a little, and make sure to tell us if you get thirsty.

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:42.190
- Should I undo the handcuffs while you eat?
- No! Don't come close.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:49.980
I get thirstier if you come closer.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.980
It's okay. I'll just eat like this.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.920
Were you okay yesterday, though?

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.860
I heard the pastor from the 12th floor came by.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:06.100
Didn't you talk to him for quite some time?

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.410
But...

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:12.540
with that guy, I wasn't that...

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.680
I guess Madness Rabies is also particular about people.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.000
Even a mosquito bites only one person out of several.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.280
But Hyung, you said the infected didn't attack the pastor, right?

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.260
He's a very devout man.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.440
He's got spiritual powers.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.760
Our Father who art in heaven,

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.130
hallowed be thy name.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.750
Thy kingdom come.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.450
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:57.020
Give us this day our daily bread,

00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:01.240
give me? Give me...

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:57.010
You still haven't cleaned up the blood? My gosh...

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.690
Is there a new infected?

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:06.080
Not yet. I should go by the third floor and 15th floor.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:10.890
Appealing to people as the building representative who protects the apartment building. Isn't that pretty good?

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:21.500
The blood. I need material to capture the infected.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:27.740
It's from the second-floor guy who's got his face covered. That prick is strange, too.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.180
Bite me if you want to.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.410
What?

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.610
I said, "Have I lost any hair?"

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:43.880
Oh, a little bit.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.030
What?

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.420
Really?

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.140
Crap!

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.830
Where did I lose it?

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.810
No, I think you're okay.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.860
- Hey.
- How is Bo Ram?

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.020
She's okay.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.900
But more than that, the water in the icebox...

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.100
Yes.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.660
The pastor didn't drink it.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.360
I thought about that, too.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.330
The infected didn't bite the pastor.

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.390
Right? And his is a pseudo-religion, too. Isn't it strange?

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:39.870
Let's go. The goal of the virus is to spread the disease.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.490
They stop sucking the blood when they feel the person's been infected.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:45.900
So how about when the infected people are together? Do they bite each other?

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.910
Probably not.

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:49.990
That's right. It only makes sense that they don't thirst for each other.

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:52.230
Then the pastor, too...

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.470
We should check.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.200
Oh...

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.300
It's a misunderstanding.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.780
Yeon Ok, let's...

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.790
talk face to face.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:23.700
Why should we look at each other, bastard?

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:26.580
When did you catch the disease?

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.720
Seung Beom gave me the drug.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.870
I guess something was in it.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:36.850
Then you should've said so!

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:41.070
Then you wouldn't have let me be!

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.690
I tried to hold myself back.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.770
I tried drinking my blood.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.210
But it was useless.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.270
I just got thirstier...

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:06.700
It's tough for me, too!

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:11.340
Should I just go down to the gym, too?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.700
Woo Chang, we've been through some hard times.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:27.040
If they find out you have the disease, I can't become the resident rep, either!

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.080
Are we going to give up like this?

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.170
Then what do we do?

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:36.750
The bedroom... if you stay in the bedroom, I'll bring you food.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:40.470
Yes. We'll just say you're sick.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:42.930
If you endure just a few more days, the soldiers will come.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:46.330
Let's just endure until then. You can do that, right?

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.400
Honey. Woo Chang?

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.860
Woo Chang!

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.550
Are you home?

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.330
Should we break down the door?

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:27.720
Hey. Calm down.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.850
I take action, and you're supposed to stop me.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.220
We should switch once in a while.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.850
Building Rep!

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:47.840
The pastor is in, right?

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.800
No. He went outside.

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:56.140
Are you sure he's not home?

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.970
Excuse me, Pastor, I'd like to pray...

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.500
Wh-What are you doing here?

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:06.920
We had a few more things to consult... and the weather is hot...

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.750
Hey, the pastor...

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:52.830
Doesn't this look more delicious?

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.230
You have to put medicine on this again.

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.970
Let's go.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.660
When he smells blood, the episodes get worse.

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.430
Go inside when he calms down.

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.760
Have you changed your mind about the infected now?

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.370
You two killed him.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.560
You did...

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:15.760
Were you in the room the whole time?

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.890
It seemed like the infected were outside.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:23.430
It's all been taken care of, right?

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.040
You must have been scared.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.670
I should've protected you.

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:55.000
But you will in the future. I trust you, Oppa.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.350
Oh Joo Hyung was with the pastor. He might be infected.

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:01.050
What do I do then?

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:04.020
It's not like I can stay over at your house.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.930
I'll try asking my wife—

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:10.790
No, you can't. She'll sense what's going on between us.

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.050
But still...

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:17.630
I told you that Oh Joo Hyung's bankruptcy is fake.

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:19.270
He invested everything into bitcoins.

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:23.770
Once I find his passcode, all of that is ours.

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.770
Where were you?

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:45.820
I heard the 12th-floor Ahjussi died. Have you heard?

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:50.250
I know! I was so shocked. I went to get some air on the rooftop.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:53.380
The rooftop? But Lee Bo Ram's there.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:56.330
Right. I just sat by the door for a moment.

00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:58.350
Obviously, I was too shocked to think clearly.

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:03.140
The 12th-floor Ahjussi's eyes turned all white...

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:06.090
You should've seen it.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:09.770
But, you know... theoretically...

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:12.630
let's say you have a very important passcode.

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:15.290
A long and complicated one that no one can find out about.

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:19.740
If you had something like that, where would you hide it?

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:20.970
I'd memorize it.

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:24.250
Or write it down without anyone knowing

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:26.440
so only I know.

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:02.340
Are you thirsty? You're not sick, are you?

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.180
Did you wash your hair? We're running out of water.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.540
What else could I do? It's itchy and uncomfortable.

00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:10.470
Don't worry. There will be a place to get water soon.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:26.730
Don't ever do this again. We don't even have antibiotics.

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:31.570
I'm a human vitamins and antibiotics. I'll be fine.

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:45.210
The pastor's death is not our fault.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:47.130
I know.

00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.040
But I still feel bad.

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:55.010
He should've told us he was sick.

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.930
It's tough to confess to being infected.

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:04.370
It must be scary to feel the desire to bite another person.

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:10.100
I'm sure you start thinking if you endure it long enough,

00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:13.110
the treatment will become available soon.

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:18.080
Afraid that the person closest to you will start to fear you...

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.380
I'm sure that's tough to deal with, too.

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.670
What? Do I have a temperature?

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.180
It seems like I do.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.160
There's a fever reducer in the room, right?

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:39.850
Take that just in case. Let's take a break tomorrow and not do anything.

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:41.780
Sleep well.

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.770
Sleep well.

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.410
I'm okay, right?

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:52.440
Goodnight.

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.780
Honey?

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:37.990
[D+3]

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:55.900
We had no idea. How could that be?

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:58.750
I heard the 12th-floor pastor was infected.

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:02.460
He passed away. Please pray for his soul.

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.800
The husband and wife totally deceived us.

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.880
I think it's best that the two of you keep order here.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.080
Did you come here to tell us that?

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.610
That and also about water.

00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:13.740
You know that we're all short on water, right?

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.680
I noticed the other day that you had a lot of water.

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:18.980
Do you want us to share our water?

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:20.730
Yours and the 15th-floor guy.

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:24.240
The others all went up to the 15th floor.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.810
I went to the rooftop, and the supermarket lady said she doesn't drink water

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:29.210
and gave us this.

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:31.880
You didn't bother Lee Bo Ram, did you?

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.600
What do you mean? We're too scared of the infected.

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:40.590
This belongs to the 15th-floor guy, right?
[Unit 1501 Kim Se Hoon]

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:44.020
He has lots of water in his house, doesn't he?

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:47.080
He does.

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.790
We're right. We should go there first.

00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:51.080
We should've gone there first.

00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:57.890
When is it going to rain?

00:57:57.890 --> 00:58:02.030
What? I'm not sensing anything.

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:08.610
But... should we share our water, too?

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.130
Never mind us. What about Seo Yoon?

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:16.250
More than that, the 15th-floor guy. The others are there right now.

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:19.580
Excuse me, open the door!

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:21.800
Oh, my gosh...

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:23.460
What is it?

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:26.520
You have a lot of water, right? Everyone is struggling.

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.790
If you have more, why not share with us? The lockdown will lift in a few days anyway.

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:30.770
What if it doesn't lift?

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:32.580
I'll pay you. Why don't you share it?

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:38.510
This cleaning guy who's like the highway robber is selling 500 ml of water for 200,000 won. It's much more expensive than gas.

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:40.580
Then you sell some, too.

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:44.200
Excuse me, I'll talk to him. Go away for now.

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.320
Doing this won't solve the problem.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.110
We should get along as residents here.

00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:49.730
- You may need legal counsel someday...
- Hello.

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:52.210
You know that the 6th-floor doctor bastard has a terrible personality, right?

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:53.530
He might set your place on fire!

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.540
Why do you call a person a bastard?

00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.920
Let's talk just for a moment.

00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:10.050
Go ahead and speak.

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:15.650
I'm sorry. It's my fault that I asked you for different things.

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:19.910
Since it's come to this, how about you share some water if you have some leftover?

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:23.550
It doesn't need to be much. Just a little bit would be enough.

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:29.230
It's not absolutely necessary that you do that, but please think about it.

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:32.430
If things get bad, we'll go outside and find some.

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:35.390
You don't need to go outside.

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:37.510
Unit 103...

00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:42.350
There's an emergency switch-over in the electrical room beneath the senior citizen center.

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:45.530
It was for the purpose of turning on the emergency light inside the elevator.

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:50.340
If you turn on the power for the entire building, the apartment electricity and water will turn on.

00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:54.080
But you're turning it on with a diesel generator.

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.950
It will make a really loud noise.

00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:59.090
The infected will swarm over when they hear the noise, right?

00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:01.740
We'll discuss it.

01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:04.880
Tomorrow.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:12.740
I'll pick out what I can give out in the morning.

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.140
Will you share some?

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:19.760
- Sir, you'll be blessed.
- Thank you.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.340
You'll be blessed.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.930
So is he going to share his water?

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:31.890
Will he share anything else? It looks like he has a lot of stuff to eat.

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:34.070
It's common sense to share the water.

01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:36.790
Please ask him to share the water with us.

01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:40.560
Please calm down. We'll hand out what we have at home.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.920
Unit 1501 says he'll think about it until tomorrow so don't disrupt him.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.050
- Let's all go down.
- We're right, aren't we?

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:49.320
- He has a lot of water, right?
- Let's go down.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.040
Let's all go down!

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.480
Will he only share half?

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.590
Come on!

01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:59.860
- Haven't you heard from Han Tae Seok yet?
- No...

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.400
I guess he'll call when he wants to.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.950
What are you looking for?

01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:06.810
Well...

01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:10.200
This.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:15.510
I got it when I went to the FBI riot squad training. It is a large.

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:18.110
But what about it?

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:23.080
I want to give it to the 15th-floor Ahjussi to thank him. He complains, but he does do everything we ask him.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.120
I also have a winning team shirt from the Italian Championship.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.500
- Should I take that, too?
- No, keep that.

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:46.310
Honey...

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:50.090
Hi, Young In. It's me.

01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:53.900
Everything feels like a dream.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:57.590
I feel like I'd be home if I wake up.

01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:03.800
Our baby...

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.180
He's fine.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.930
Honey...

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:22.410
Could you take out our baby first?

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:26.420
It's highly possible that he'll be born infected.

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.200
He shares your blood.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.540
- Honey.
- Yes?

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:41.160
Our baby... You can't give up on him. Okay?

01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:43.960
I know.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.370
We can't postpone the delivery any longer.

01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:01.270
You must make a decision.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:03.890
If the miscarriage was possible, we would have sooner.

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:09.660
If Young In's physical balance is destroyed and the baby is gone, her infection could worsen.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.060
But still, you must choose.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:19.580
Who would you choose to save if you had to save only one person?

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.840
There's only one choice for me.

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:29.490
Yoon Sae Bom's blood analysis is out.

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:32.030
She has antibodies.

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:50.750
[D+4]

01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:58.190
- I'll be back.
- Should I go with you?

01:04:58.190 --> 01:05:01.120
No. He seems to get sensitive when he sees you.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.590
Shy people tend to do that. I'll be right back.

01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:07.830
Be careful there.

01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:25.360

Jung Yi Hyun.

What do you think a mistake you can't turn back means?

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:20.630
I received the background check on the apartment residents, and there's something strange.

01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:22.570
Do you really think Kim Se Hoon did it?

01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:24.100
A person died.

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:27.640
That's not important right now! The food is gone!

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.700
- Is it very dangerous?
- Prepare the infiltration team.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:35.050
Please help Sae Bom so she can live safely.

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:38.960
This will be my last request.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.190
Hyun!

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:47.990
