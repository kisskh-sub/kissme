00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.020
(Sirichalalai Palace, Bangkok, Thailand)

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.040
You'd like to hold a welcome party for me?

00:01:22.237 --> 00:01:23.238
That's right.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.140
We should announce to everyone
that Prince Saenkaew of Chansaeng

00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:31.140
will is soon-to-be my son-in-law.

00:01:31.483 --> 00:01:33.740
The party will be the talk of the town.

00:01:34.137 --> 00:01:36.140
Everyone in Bangkok will be surprised.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.200
- You think so?
- Sure, I do.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.820
I can help you out with the guest list.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.420
I can do it.

00:01:48.157 --> 00:01:51.380
If I let you do it,
we will only have a bunch of nobody guests.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.060
Did your dad tell you when he will arrive?

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.940
He said that he would arrive next month.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.060
He must be busy with
transferring his assets.

00:02:10.283 --> 00:02:11.284
Butâ€¦

00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:13.900
you don't have to worry about it.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.060
I'm here to help you.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.180
After the marriage,
your assets can be transferred to Pin.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.780
And all of your family members
can relocate to Thailand.

00:02:23.903 --> 00:02:26.260
That will stop them from harming us.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.820
There're so many details about it.

00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:32.403
This is a big topic to discuss,
we should talk about it later.

00:02:32.823 --> 00:02:34.103
It's not a big topic to discuss.

00:02:34.337 --> 00:02:37.700
I heard that your dad

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:40.420
wanted to work in the timber
industry in Chiang Mai.

00:02:40.643 --> 00:02:43.820
I can help with finding
agents and a furniture factory.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.780
We're practically family.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.860
We're building a successful
business together.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.180
- Isn't that right, honey?
- That's right.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 2)

00:02:58.617 --> 00:03:00.660
So? What's going on?

00:03:01.323 --> 00:03:04.020
What's the update from Kamfah's family?

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.421
I have some information.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.000
Prince Kamfah and Prince Saenkaew
had an argument the other day.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.620
Prince Bodin's daughter, you know her well.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.811
I'm not getting married.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.140
This is about my entire life's happiness.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.020
Why're you forcing me? You're so selfish.

00:03:27.483 --> 00:03:30.100
How dare you talk about your own happiness!

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.260
Who is the selfish one now?

00:03:34.963 --> 00:03:35.964
Yeah?

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.900
How are they doing now?

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.780
Prince Saenkaew has left
for Thailand for days now.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.780
He's in Thailand now?

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.860
Your reward for bringing news.

00:03:54.343 --> 00:03:56.800
See? This is what I expected.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.500
Kamfah planned for his son
to marry his friend's daughter,

00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:02.300
in order to transfer his assets.

00:04:06.337 --> 00:04:07.338
It's still strange.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.340
It sounded like a good plan.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.300
Why did they still have an argument?

00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:15.700
A young man doesn't like to be forced
when it comes to love.

00:04:20.683 --> 00:04:22.540
If there's anyone you'd like to invite,

00:04:22.677 --> 00:04:25.100
or you'd like to add something,
you can let my dad know.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.420
He will follow your requests for sure.

00:04:35.443 --> 00:04:36.444
Grandma!

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.740
You're gonna fall!

00:04:39.077 --> 00:04:40.180
Grandma!

00:04:40.477 --> 00:04:42.380
Grandma? What's going on?

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.890
I heard your grandma talked to Homthip that
she'd like some mangoes.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.220
So I volunteered to pick some for her.

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.061
You climbed up too high.

00:04:59.603 --> 00:05:02.980
I'm worried that you'll fall.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.460
You don't have to worry about him.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.060
He's good at climbing trees,
even better than a monkey.

00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:12.140
I heard your scream and

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.100
I thought that your
heart condition acted up.

00:05:14.143 --> 00:05:16.820
- I was so worried.
- Thank you for that.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.100
You're overthinking.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.260
Grandma still looks so young

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.940
- and so strong.
- Wow!

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.540
- Such a sweet talker.
- You think this is a joke?

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.781
If something happened to her,
can you be responsible for that?

00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:41.990
Oh my! Grandma, look.

00:05:42.582 --> 00:05:45.860
He isn't pleased with anything I say.

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:47.670
Come on.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.940
Sasin didn't mean to scare me or anything.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.340
Don't blame him, okay?

00:05:57.837 --> 00:05:58.838
Here are your mangoes.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.660
Are you free this afternoon?
Would you like to hang out at my place?

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.380
I can play the violin for you.

00:06:09.877 --> 00:06:12.220
He's a good violinist.

00:06:12.697 --> 00:06:15.020
It's the only thing he's good at.

00:06:17.217 --> 00:06:19.180
- Let's go, Grandma.
- That's right.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.451
Maybe some other time.

00:06:21.451 --> 00:06:23.500
Don't you have a cooking class with Pin?

00:06:23.823 --> 00:06:26.610
You're right. I totally forgot.

00:06:47.304 --> 00:06:48.867
What's with the face?

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.460
You don't want me here? Learning with you?

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:55.340
That's not true.

00:06:55.483 --> 00:06:58.100
The more the merrier.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.380
How is this one?

00:07:00.963 --> 00:07:02.940
They're lovely.

00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:10.772
You look so grumpy, Little Rabbit.

00:07:12.423 --> 00:07:14.580
Who did you call a rabbit?

00:07:17.877 --> 00:07:18.878
What?

00:07:19.878 --> 00:07:21.820
I was talking to my Luk
Chup that looks like a rabbit.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.220
That's a cute rabbit you made.

00:07:31.797 --> 00:07:32.798
That's right.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.020
Can I have this one?

00:07:37.143 --> 00:07:39.460
Well, I don't think so.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.460
I wanted to make this one for Mr. Saenkaew.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:04.340
Prince Saenkaew, your dad's on the phone.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.863
- Dad?
- Is anyone around?

00:08:25.197 --> 00:08:26.198
Nobody's here.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.340
We can't let anyone know about this,
especially Prince Bodin.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:30.941
What is it?

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:33.600
We got a problem about
money transferring to Thailand.

00:08:34.657 --> 00:08:35.980
Kalong knows about it.

00:08:38.337 --> 00:08:39.460
What? How did he find out?

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.460
Someone must have tipped him off.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.340
You have to be very
cautious when staying there.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.841
Kalong won't stop for sure.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.261
Got it.

00:09:32.657 --> 00:09:33.658
Field Marshal?

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.380
Saenkaew didn't want to get married?

00:09:43.143 --> 00:09:45.060
And he fought with his dad about it?

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.871
This is weird.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.100
That's right. My spy didn't lie about it.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.781
Marriage will help with movement of assets.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.060
And it can help his whole entire family.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.620
I'm questioning the same thing.

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:09.582
What about this? I can look into it myself.

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:18.818
Hey!

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.220
I'm always ready to be
a good citizen of Nanta.

00:10:22.941 --> 00:10:24.942
I want Nanta to earn a lot of money.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.420
To develop and grow the nation.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.641
Can I trust you?

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.750
They said blood is thicker than water.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.380
Blood may be thicker than water

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.380
but my nationalist
heart is the thickest.

00:10:47.723 --> 00:10:48.724
Gen. Kalong.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.420
Chansaeng is not under you just yet.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.300
It's inconvenient for you
to do anything, isn't it?

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.061
But I have a spy

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.421
living at their place to report
their moves to me all the time.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.750
I also know

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.660
Prince Kamfah and Prince
Saenkaew really well.

00:11:10.341 --> 00:11:12.460
I can even foresee their next moves.

00:11:13.397 --> 00:11:14.398
Come on.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.501
Let me help you.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.261
I heard that there're some disagreements
between Kamfah and his brother.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.450
About assets and inheritance.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:37.100
If you're successful in
finding out about Saenkaew,

00:11:37.897 --> 00:11:39.800
getting in the way of their marriage,

00:11:39.877 --> 00:11:41.820
and transferring their assets,

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.200
I'll consider you as doing
something good for the nation.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.420
The assets that I can seize from Kamfah...

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.950
I'll share them to you as your reward.

00:11:56.721 --> 00:11:58.191
I will do my best

00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.861
for Nanta.

00:12:07.337 --> 00:12:09.737
The Field Marshal refrains from
welcoming guests these days.

00:12:12.277 --> 00:12:16.012
I can't even see him for just one second?

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.500
He isn't available, truly.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.670
Sorry about that.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.341
Come on in, please.

00:12:24.903 --> 00:12:25.904
Yes, sir.

00:12:30.337 --> 00:12:31.900
Please see him out.

00:12:34.957 --> 00:12:35.958
This way, please.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.540
Ms. Songsawat, please come this way.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.100
The Field Marshal is
waiting for you, welcome.

00:13:05.437 --> 00:13:06.438
This way, please.

00:13:07.623 --> 00:13:08.624
Please follow me.

00:13:23.817 --> 00:13:24.818
How was it?

00:13:26.317 --> 00:13:28.620
Why did you need to
visit the Field Marshal?

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.861
He's a powerful man in Thailand,
that could stand up against Kalong.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.140
If I could ask him to store our assets,

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.020
Kalong won't have a chance
to fight against him for sure.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.220
And I won't have to act
like I'm using Pin for this matter.

00:13:44.743 --> 00:13:46.420
Ms. Pin is a nice lady.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.340
And it seems like she really likes you.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.431
If the wedding is postponed,

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.980
she will be so devastated.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.860
But if we're forced to get married,

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.580
she will be even more devastated.

00:14:05.603 --> 00:14:07.683
She deserves to be with
someone who's right for her,

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.750
someone who loves her
and can take good care of her,

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.660
not someone like me.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.820
If you couldn't meet him,

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.340
what's your next move?

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.900
Ms. Songsawat, please come this way.

00:14:35.017 --> 00:14:38.340
The Field Marshal is
waiting for you, welcome.

00:14:42.843 --> 00:14:44.500
That lady is so familiar.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.301
It's her.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.681
What're you doing, Saenkaew?

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.661
Pin.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.860
Do you know her?

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.940
Her name is Ms. Songsawat Pilatlakkana.

00:15:18.263 --> 00:15:20.800
She's an actress and does beauty pageants.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.351
A sex bomb.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.980
Everyone is kind of scared of her.

00:15:28.397 --> 00:15:29.398
Scared?

00:15:29.917 --> 00:15:30.918
Why's that?

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.860
Because she's a good actress?
That's why people scared of her?

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.340
That's not it.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.300
She's the Field Marshal's
favorite mistress.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.571
Prince Kamfah?

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.820
We got a situation.

00:16:22.617 --> 00:16:23.618
Gen. Kalong.

00:16:24.887 --> 00:16:26.807
You need to bring your
soldiers out of my house.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.180
Chansaeng isn't ruled by you.

00:16:36.297 --> 00:16:37.500
Mr. Kamfah.

00:16:38.883 --> 00:16:40.180
Why're you so mad about this?

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.980
I'm not intruding.

00:16:45.252 --> 00:16:46.612
I'm just saying hi to my neighbor.

00:16:47.623 --> 00:16:48.624
A neighbor?

00:16:49.624 --> 00:16:50.625
What do you mean?

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.340
I need to run some errands in Chansaeng.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.621
Like meetings and
discussions with France about

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.460
handing over Chansaeng to Nanta.

00:16:59.997 --> 00:17:01.750
To make the handover go smoothly.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.060
I need to stay here for a while.

00:17:06.843 --> 00:17:09.980
My place is right next to
yours, what a coincidence.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.223
I hope you go back to where you belong!

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.260
Leave my place alone
or you'll see what I can do!

00:17:20.903 --> 00:17:21.904
Understood.

00:17:24.503 --> 00:17:25.504
Right.

00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:29.380
Please say hi to

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.380
Mr. Saenkaew for me.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.220
I heard that he'll get married soon.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.620
I'll send my people to retrieve
a wedding invitation from here.

00:17:56.777 --> 00:17:57.778
Let's go.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.180
Kalong keeps an eye on us for sure.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.380
Call Mr. Consul.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.500
I'll ask him

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.580
to help me work on transferring
money to Thailand faster.

00:18:19.995 --> 00:18:21.772
But I need to organize the wedding

00:18:22.697 --> 00:18:25.940
of Saenkaew and Pinanong
faster than we planned.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:33.501
Yes, sir.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.823
These are songs to play in
Mr. Saenkaew's welcome party?

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.061
That's right.

00:18:49.657 --> 00:18:50.658
That's right?

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.060
Are you crazy? These are all sad songs.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.600
This is a welcome party for Pin's fiancÃ©

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.600
not a lonely heart's club.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.260
Such a whiner.

00:19:04.923 --> 00:19:05.924
I'll take care of it.

00:19:07.739 --> 00:19:09.018
You should've taken
care of it from the start.

00:19:09.043 --> 00:19:10.044
What?

00:19:22.197 --> 00:19:24.903
I know that you're sad because
Pin is engaged to someone.

00:19:25.732 --> 00:19:29.252
You should get over it already.
She's like an angel, but youâ€¦

00:19:29.963 --> 00:19:30.964
You're like an ugly dog.

00:19:31.597 --> 00:19:35.098
What? You're not gonna console me?

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.540
If he finds out that you
have a crush on his cousin,

00:19:38.663 --> 00:19:40.223
he'll stomp you to the ground for sure.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.820
One more thing, I don't think
he'd let her date you for sure.

00:19:45.337 --> 00:19:46.338
Fine.

00:19:48.377 --> 00:19:49.740
I just wanted to know

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.420
how much that Prince Saenkaew guy

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.200
is better than me.

00:19:55.517 --> 00:19:56.860
Sasin!

00:20:04.677 --> 00:20:05.678
What're you doing?

00:20:10.337 --> 00:20:11.338
Selecting songs.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.460
I think he is 2,500
times better than you are.

00:20:18.203 --> 00:20:19.204
Pin?

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.660
Mingmitr and Sanya, I'd like
to introduce you to someone.

00:20:25.297 --> 00:20:27.200
This is Prince Saenkaew.

00:20:28.117 --> 00:20:31.340
Saenkaew, this is Mingmitr and Sanya.

00:20:31.557 --> 00:20:33.317
They're Sasin's closest
friends in the band.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.200
Hello.

00:20:41.043 --> 00:20:42.140
Nice to meet all of you.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.101
Good that you're here.

00:20:55.316 --> 00:20:57.756
Pin's dad wanted us to
play in your welcome party.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.700
Do you have any special
songs you'd like us to play?

00:21:03.297 --> 00:21:04.800
I'm not good with music.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.300
So it's up to you.

00:21:07.177 --> 00:21:08.630
Oh, come on.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.660
You don't need to tell me now.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:13.691
What about this?

00:21:14.297 --> 00:21:16.337
Why don't you hang out
for a drink with us tonight?

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.460
We can talk about songs, sounds good?

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.420
- Well, Iâ€¦
- Come on.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.421
You said no to me before.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.900
If you refused to hang
out with me again,

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.980
I couldn't help but
but think that

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.420
you disliked me for sure.

00:21:37.123 --> 00:21:40.370
I think it's better to hang out with them.

00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:42.900
Sounds like fun, I'll be here too.

00:21:43.657 --> 00:21:45.580
No, you can't.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.740
If Khunying Wad sees you in drinking group,

00:21:48.867 --> 00:21:50.067
we'll get scolded at for sure.

00:21:50.273 --> 00:21:53.220
They're not home. They'll
have a party to attend to.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.500
I can stay, all clear.

00:21:58.103 --> 00:22:00.460
Good. You can cook us side dishes.

00:22:02.343 --> 00:22:06.020
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.051
Go downstairs.

00:23:07.997 --> 00:23:09.380
Thank you, Sasin.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.991
Saenkaew?

00:23:32.617 --> 00:23:33.660
Are you feeling better?

00:23:35.837 --> 00:23:38.100
You should rest. I'll help you.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.860
No need to.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.941
You should go and hang out with them.

00:23:50.341 --> 00:23:52.580
Let us women do the kitchen work.

00:23:54.497 --> 00:23:56.220
We're all the same.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.580
I'll help you cook and
it will be done faster.

00:24:00.061 --> 00:24:01.981
So you can hang out and
have fun with us faster.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.460
You're so good at this.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.100
You're good at desserts and cooking.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:18.941
I'm not that good.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.860
Khunying Wad likes to
call me a troublemaker.

00:24:28.743 --> 00:24:31.220
A troublemaker how? I don't get it.

00:24:33.263 --> 00:24:34.264
Wellâ€¦

00:24:35.677 --> 00:24:37.580
Just being me is trouble enough, I guess.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.781
I'm a cook's daughter.

00:24:42.663 --> 00:24:46.420
I don't act like an aristocrat or a lady.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.460
I often embarrass them.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.251
I totally understand you.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.900
Perhaps, just being ourselves

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.660
could cause trouble to someone.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.100
But it's their problem.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.620
Don't let it become yours.

00:25:12.617 --> 00:25:16.020
Let them solve their own problems.

00:25:16.923 --> 00:25:17.924
Right?

00:25:19.917 --> 00:25:20.918
Right.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.740
When it comes to not being
an aristocrat or a lady,

00:25:26.863 --> 00:25:28.140
don't let that bother you.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.180
If you have a chance, you
should just live your life.

00:25:34.903 --> 00:25:35.940
Be yourself.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.641
Don't please anyone.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.980
I think that kind of life

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.580
is the best kind of life.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.391
Thank you so much.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.620
I'm so lucky to get to know you.

00:26:05.143 --> 00:26:06.540
I'm not that good person.

00:26:19.037 --> 00:26:21.140
Food is here.

00:26:28.243 --> 00:26:29.244
Nice smell.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.011
Wait, wait.

00:26:34.263 --> 00:26:36.837
We need to celebrate our friendship first.

00:26:39.203 --> 00:26:40.204
This is what we do.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.700
Cheers!

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:47.100
Come on, cheers!

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.031
Bottoms up!

00:26:53.017 --> 00:26:54.018
Sure thing.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.781
Let's go.

00:27:05.883 --> 00:27:07.260
Can you handle it?

00:27:20.643 --> 00:27:22.540
Let me get you a refill.

00:27:33.157 --> 00:27:34.660
Hey, what're you doing?

00:27:35.497 --> 00:27:37.017
Why did you put so much whiskey in it?

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:39.700
You told me

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.800
that Prince Saenkaew never said a word
about his feeling towards Pin.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.661
This is it.

00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:48.300
I'll a mix strong drink
so he'd be drunk and saying something.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:51.671
Thank you.

00:27:53.557 --> 00:27:55.220
I think it's a good idea.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.460
Ms. Pin, your dad and
Khunying Wad are here.

00:28:02.511 --> 00:28:03.900
They're also asking for you.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.620
They said they'd come home late.

00:28:09.017 --> 00:28:10.380
I better go.

00:28:10.717 --> 00:28:12.180
- I should go.
- Wait, Pin!

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.420
Where are you going?

00:28:15.843 --> 00:28:18.580
You promised us that
you'd hang out with us.

00:28:20.323 --> 00:28:21.324
Here's your drink.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:30.231
Cheers!

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:34.060
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:28:34.943 --> 00:28:36.140
Bottoms up!

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.700
Why're you so quiet?

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:04.751
Let's drink!

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.420
- Come on, cheer!
- Hey!

00:29:08.863 --> 00:29:11.340
Sasin, come on! Let's drink.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.591
Cheers!

00:29:15.643 --> 00:29:16.644
Bottoms up, okay?

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.500
I can't drink anymore.

00:29:31.883 --> 00:29:34.860
Sanya, you can't stop. Let's go.

00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:45.940
One more bottle?

00:29:53.137 --> 00:29:54.260
I can't take it anymore.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:48.300
You don't look like a person
who's good at drinking.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.900
You think I don't know that
you tried to get me drunk?

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.420
Distilled liquor in Chansaeng is so strong
that it could start a fire.

00:31:01.101 --> 00:31:02.620
What we drank tonight was just water.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.941
Just water?

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.620
You're quite something.

00:31:10.237 --> 00:31:11.820
You knew our plan so you tricked us?

00:31:14.723 --> 00:31:16.620
I think I should warn Pin

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.341
to be careful around you.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.500
I told you that I only meant well to her.

00:31:25.923 --> 00:31:26.924
Hey!

00:31:28.337 --> 00:31:30.860
Pin is really happy when you're around.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.681
I'd like to ask you to take care of her.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.100
But there's one thing,

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.060
you often have your grumpy face on.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.460
It's like you have something to hide.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.780
Everyone has their bad side,

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.820
their disgusting side

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.461
that they don't want anyone to see.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.261
You're right.

00:32:15.197 --> 00:32:18.100
I believe there's one person in our lives

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.340
that we can share
absolutely everything with,

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.140
both good and bad things.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.500
They won't judge us

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.020
and they will stand by
our sides no matter what.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.940
We'll find them someday for sure.

00:34:50.963 --> 00:34:54.157
Why're you so active today?
Cleaning from the early morning.

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.540
Mingmitr and Sanya
were so drunk last night.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.260
They puked all over my house.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:05.180
And they're gone, they left me
to clean the house by myself.

00:35:05.457 --> 00:35:07.220
- You deserved it.
- What?

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.580
After I left last night,

00:35:10.663 --> 00:35:13.100
did you make fun of my Saenkaew?

00:35:13.877 --> 00:35:17.140
You're worried about
him? He's not that innocent.

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:18.810
Nobody could do anything to him.

00:35:20.343 --> 00:35:21.800
I've observed him

00:35:22.883 --> 00:35:24.820
and I think he is all right.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.340
He passed my criteria.

00:35:28.541 --> 00:35:31.300
But just the first step.

00:35:33.742 --> 00:35:37.580
Just the first one? How
many steps do you have?

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.157
There are 38,000 steps.

00:35:44.261 --> 00:35:46.700
I'll be 60 when all steps are completed.

00:35:47.017 --> 00:35:48.018
Maybe older.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:56.860
I told you already that he is a good man.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.901
If you get to know him a little bit more,

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.980
you will like him like I do.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.060
What're you thinking? Still hangover?

00:36:30.503 --> 00:36:33.420
I'll put these on dishes for you.

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.141
So yummy.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.631
Come on in, please.

00:37:13.243 --> 00:37:17.620
Khunying Wad wanted
me to give you the guest list.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.061
(Ms. Songsawat Pilatlakkana)

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.460
Her name is Ms. Songsawat Pilatlakkana.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:38.140
She's the Field Marshal's
favorite mistress.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.460
I'll have someone take care of your place.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.660
So you don't have to stay at a motel.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.580
I really need to thank
you for arranging all of this.

00:37:59.503 --> 00:38:01.100
We appreciate your help.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.900
You're welcome.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.460
You're a friend of Gen.Kalong.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.550
Gen. Kalong and I are good friends.

00:38:10.077 --> 00:38:12.060
So you're my guest.

00:38:12.537 --> 00:38:13.660
Thank you so much.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.380
If you don't mind me asking,

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.220
what's that invitation for?

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.380
From Sirichalalai Palace of Prince Bodin.

00:38:25.977 --> 00:38:29.140
A welcome party for Prince
Saenkaew, your nephew.

00:38:36.103 --> 00:38:37.220
Well,

00:38:38.003 --> 00:38:40.620
they used scented hard paper.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.700
They must be so excited about
their soon-to-be son-in-law.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.341
They invited everyone in Bangkok.
Sure, they must be so excited.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.531
Right.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:55.020
Prince Saenkaew asked to see
the Field Marshal the other day,

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.300
Really?

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:03.140
Why did he want to see
the leader of Thailand?

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.780
I'm not sure.

00:39:05.381 --> 00:39:07.382
Because I didn't bring him to see my boss.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:12.581
Excuse me, sir.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.860
- Please excuse me for a minute.
- Sure, take your time.

00:39:24.261 --> 00:39:26.940
You think it's about your
nephew not wanting to get married?

00:39:33.417 --> 00:39:35.060
We'll find out soon enough.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.700
Can you lift it up? Our
guests could walk into it.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.660
Right, this is high enough.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.081
This is huge.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.180
How much did you loan for this party?

00:40:02.221 --> 00:40:06.220
A lot, but we need to organize a big party,

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.260
and invite many guests to witness

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.020
the fact that Pin will
marry Prince Saenkaew.

00:40:12.363 --> 00:40:15.780
Prince Kamfah won't
change his mind for sure.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:19.940
Such a fruitful investment,
don't you think so?

00:40:21.221 --> 00:40:22.780
Well, you paid for the party already.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:25.020
What else can I say but agree with you?

00:40:37.683 --> 00:40:39.620
I'm glad you could make it, Doctor.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:53.420
Hey! Who're you looking for?

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.740
A host. I haven't seen him.

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:34.260
Pin! Over here!

00:41:35.097 --> 00:41:38.300
I hope you remember my daughter, Pin.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.170
Pin is so beautiful like an angel.

00:41:48.463 --> 00:41:50.460
Well, she walks with another angel.

00:41:51.237 --> 00:41:53.260
Can you not disagree with me for once?

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.860
Why don't you take them to the table?

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.700
Little Rabbit looks so dapper tonight.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.980
What rabbit?

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.220
Forget about the rabbit, let's go and play.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.581
Let's go.

00:42:45.637 --> 00:42:47.670
He's a good violinist.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:44.610
A glass of champagne, please.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:06.180
Grandma, can you stay
here with Pin for a minute?

00:44:06.797 --> 00:44:09.180
- Are you making the rounds?
- Yes.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.220
Go ahead, dear.

00:44:10.523 --> 00:44:13.380
- I'll take care of her.
- Thank you.

00:44:21.543 --> 00:44:26.900
A person you asked me to look for is here.

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:31.020
Is this the one?

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.660
I heard that she's the latest
mistress of the Field Marshal.

00:44:33.723 --> 00:44:36.220
That's right. Look at the way she dressed.

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:40.300
It's like she wants everyone
to know about her past jobs.

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:44.220
How dare she attend a
party in the palace like this?

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.781
Seeing her here makes me want to go home.

00:44:47.703 --> 00:44:48.820
Disgusting.

00:45:24.737 --> 00:45:25.857
Good evening, Ms. Songsawat.

00:45:31.663 --> 00:45:33.700
- You?
- My name is Saenkaew.

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.860
Prince Saenkaew? The host of the party.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.620
Nice to meet you.

00:45:45.123 --> 00:45:46.124
Nice to meet you, too.

00:45:48.777 --> 00:45:50.420
Prince Bodin's future son-in-law.

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:54.580
He must admire you so
much, look how big the party is.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.101
I'll cut to the chase.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.641
I need to ask you a favor.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.381
A favor?

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.340
You want to be a star?

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.300
I want to meet the Field Marshal.

00:46:11.963 --> 00:46:13.420
Wait, hear me out.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.580
I really need his help.

00:46:17.997 --> 00:46:19.803
My family is in big trouble.

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.740
Our assets could be seized
or we could be executed.

00:46:26.861 --> 00:46:29.140
I heard thousands of
people say the same thing.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.460
You just want to meet him,
to take advantage of him.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.460
It's quite entertaining to
see children of aristocrats

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.220
and wealthy people like you

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.900
stoop down to talk to a sex bomb like me.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.200
I would never consider talking to you
is some kind of stooping down.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.020
I read your biography.

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.420
I think you're a brave woman.

00:46:53.543 --> 00:46:56.177
Brave? You're gonna call me shameless

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:59.261
for being naked in films
and being his mistress?

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:00.291
Of course not.

00:47:00.703 --> 00:47:03.020
I think you're brave for
choosing your own path,

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.380
and not caring about others.

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.100
I want to be brave like you.

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.300
To be yourself and to
not care about others.

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:17.581
You know what?

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.420
There're so many things I want to do

00:47:23.221 --> 00:47:24.301
but I can't do any of them.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.381
I'm fascinated by you.

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:42.020
See you later.

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:47.211
Grandma?

00:47:47.637 --> 00:47:49.740
I'll look around for you.

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.860
Sasin, did you see Saenkaew anywhere?

00:47:59.043 --> 00:48:00.820
I've looked around and I didn't see him.

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.260
I haven't. What's going on?

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:08.380
Grandma's old friend moved
from Chansaeng to Bangkok.

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.381
She wanted to introduce her to Saenkaew.

00:48:11.217 --> 00:48:14.140
I see. I'll let him know when I see him.

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:16.230
Thank you.

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:28.691
I'll be right back.

00:48:29.417 --> 00:48:30.418
I'll be right back.

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.700
You're fun to hang out with,

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.340
you're not boring like other aristocrats.

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:42.500
You're actually an intellectual person.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.780
I never thought that you're
interested in various social issues.

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.083
You said you wanted to
meet the Field Marshal,

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.340
I'll talk to him about you
when I have a chance.

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.221
Thank you so much.

00:49:03.357 --> 00:49:04.358
Thank you so much.

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:14.420
I should call it a night,
let's hang out later.

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:26.260
I'm sorry, I think I drank too much.

00:49:26.597 --> 00:49:27.898
- Thanks.
- Are you okay?

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:29.251
Yeah.

00:49:37.457 --> 00:49:38.458
Mr. Saenkaew!

00:49:38.943 --> 00:49:40.900
Why didn't you make a sound? You scared me.

00:49:41.237 --> 00:49:43.140
Is Saenkaew here?

00:49:51.817 --> 00:49:52.818
- Come here.
- What?

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.381
What's going on?

00:49:55.157 --> 00:49:57.390
Hey! Let me go!

00:49:58.297 --> 00:50:00.820
- Are you insane?
- I should be the one asking you that!

00:50:01.197 --> 00:50:02.420
You disrespected my cousin.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.061
What did I do?

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:05.671
Quit acting so innocent!

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.460
I saw what you did with that sex star.

00:50:08.661 --> 00:50:10.820
How could you insult her with that tone?

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:13.740
She has an honest job as an actress.

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:15.741
You defended her?

00:50:16.343 --> 00:50:18.133
Did you know that she's
the Field Marshal's mistress?

00:50:18.157 --> 00:50:20.620
You're gonna have an affair
with someone's mistress?

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.620
You're overreacting! I
was just talking to her.

00:50:23.883 --> 00:50:26.780
- About what?
- It's none of your business.

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:30.180
You can't tell me because you
made out with her, didn't you?

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.380
That's why when I
asked you if you loved Pin,

00:50:32.717 --> 00:50:34.460
- you couldn't answer me.
- Hey!

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.900
I just met her tonight.

00:50:36.037 --> 00:50:38.038
- We didn't do anything.
- You didn't?

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:41.380
- Why did you hold her?
- She almost fell so I caught her.

00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.380
She fell how? I saw you held her.

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.100
- I'm not talking to you anymore.
- Where're you going?

00:50:47.297 --> 00:50:48.620
- We need to talk.
- Let me go!

00:50:48.717 --> 00:50:51.517
No, I won't! How did she fell?
Why did it look like you're holding her?

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:54.421
Come back here.

00:51:40.923 --> 00:51:41.924
Can you picture it now?

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:44.700
This is how she was about to fall.
