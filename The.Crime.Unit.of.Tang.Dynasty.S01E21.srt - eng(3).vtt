WEBVTT

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:00.541
What did you do to them?

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.291
They couldn't even resist the simplest temptations.

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.875
Now they're nothing but lowly playthings in the gambling house.

00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.000
Just for everyone's amusement.

00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:10.416
It's fine to take a little, isn't it?

00:01:33.916 --> 00:01:35.625
On my turf,

00:01:35.708 --> 00:01:37.750
you follow my rules.

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:38.875
If you want to fight,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.125
you'll end up just like those on stage.

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:48.125
Lord Ghost King,

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:50.750
why don't you set the rules?

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:52.041
What must I do to save them?

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:53.750
You do understand the rules.

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:56.291
First round of the Life-and-Death Gambling.

00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:57.375
The winner

00:01:57.458 --> 00:01:59.208
gets them as slaves.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.208
Free to command and toy with.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.250
If you lose,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.750
you all die together.

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:07.166
Isn't that entertaining?

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:10.416
Making officials into dog slavesâ€”what a trick.

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:17.166
Let's gamble, then.

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:20.708
First round: arrow toss game.

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:21.833
Three arrows.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.333
Each arrow that lands saves one person.

00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:26.250
There are three rounds.

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:28.500
But if you miss,

00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.083
I'll kill one at random.

00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:33.166
Young Hero, save me!

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.500
I'll be your slave if you help me.

00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:36.041
I'll give you all my wealth.

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:37.000
Save me first!

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:38.125
My father has ten thousand taels of silver.

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:38.958
If I get out, it's all yours.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.791
Yes, Young Hero,

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:40.750
as long as you get me out,

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:41.625
I'll do whatever you say.

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:42.458
Anything you command.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.125
Three arrows to save four people.

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:45.833
Even if you hit every round,

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:47.625
one will still die, won't they?

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:50.208
If you don't want to gamble, you can still leave now.

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:52.625
I'll gamble.

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:54.583
Let's begin.

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:21.583
You're cheating.

00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:23.375
I never said

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:24.958
the pot wouldn't move.

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:29.291
Don't kill me! Please don't!

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:31.041
Can you do it or not?

00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:32.375
I'm risking my life here!

00:03:32.416 --> 00:03:33.708
If you can't do it, don't gamble.

00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:34.708
Well?

00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:36.125
You want to save them,

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.541
but they blame you for their misfortune.

00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:40.708
That's human nature.

00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:42.458
I'll give you a chance.

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:44.375
Give up the gamble.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.333
Save yourself.

00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:47.291
This round is called "Ghost Hunt."

00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:49.208
I guess this means I win.

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:51.125
Surprised, aren't you?

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:52.458
You're quite clever.

00:04:53.416 --> 00:04:54.708
But I wonder,

00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:56.083
with this final arrow,

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:57.583
how will you save two people?

00:04:58.083 --> 00:04:58.791
Young Hero,

00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.166
I have an eighty-year-old mother at home

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.916
waiting for me to care for her.

00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:01.875
Don't just save your friends.

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:02.958
Save me too!

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.250
Just shut up already.

00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:45.750
What's going on?

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.208
Everyone, don't panic.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.375
Why don't we make a guess?

00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:49.625
The last arrow,

00:05:49.708 --> 00:05:51.291
will it land in the pot as hoped?

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:53.291
Guessing is boring.

00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:55.458
Lord Ghost King, why not light the lamp?

00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:57.333
Let's see if the arrow hit or not.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:00.125
Light the lamp.

00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:08.083
Lord Ghost King told me

00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:10.708
as long as the arrow enters the pot, it's a win.

00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:12.958
If that's the case,

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.750
then I should have won both rounds.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.875
Release them.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.791
Luo Han.

00:06:26.208 --> 00:06:28.458
Young Hero, thank you for saving me.

00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:29.875
Don't gamble again.

00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:30.916
Sigh.

00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:39.958
I won, so why do you still want to kill him?

00:06:40.416 --> 00:06:42.458
He signed this contract before.

00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:44.458
His life and death are mine to decide.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.500
Even if you save him,

00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:49.000
it doesn't mean he'll survive.

00:06:49.416 --> 00:06:50.833
You're shameless.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.708
You've already received the reward for the first round.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.666
Your friend is deeply poisoned.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.833
If you want the antidote,

00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:59.458
you must gamble the second round with me, the shameless one.

00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:02.000
Do you dare to gamble?

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.083
I do.

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:19.500
For the second round,

00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:22.708
we'll play something different.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.833
But I want someone else to play.

00:07:31.541 --> 00:07:32.625
Sheng Li.

00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:34.500
Why her?

00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:36.833
She will gamble with you this round.

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:38.958
Dice rolling, higher number wins.

00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:40.541
Three rounds in total.

00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:41.875
The winner

00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:44.083
not only gets what you want,

00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:46.541
I'll also grant one extra wish.

00:07:46.708 --> 00:07:48.333
But the loser

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.750
must sign a Life-and-Death Contract with me.

00:07:50.791 --> 00:07:52.166
And stay here forever.

00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:54.125
For my amusement.

00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:57.666
Sir,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.666
you've already helped me.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.875
I'm truly grateful.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.750
But they're threatening me with my child.

00:08:06.583 --> 00:08:08.333
I really have no choice.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.375
This is my only chance.

00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:12.916
I have no other option.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.333
How pitiful.

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:17.000
If you win,

00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:18.541
you'll have to destroy

00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:20.500
someone you once saved.

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.083
If you lose,

00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:24.583
you'll sacrifice your brother's life.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.833
This is getting more interesting.

00:08:29.083 --> 00:08:30.208
Enough talk.

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:31.750
Let's begin.

00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:47.458
The sound is light.

00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:48.708
This round is small.

00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:49.458
Small.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.291
Can't you even play such a simple game?

00:08:51.375 --> 00:08:52.500
Hurry and guess.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.583
This round is big.
