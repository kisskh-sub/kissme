00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.880
Whoa.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.090
Oh,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.480
I had no intent to follow you, milord.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.120
I was merely concerned

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.840
for the safety of you two.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.870
Lord Sun,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.780
you have my word.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.470
If blame comes from above,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.660
I'll bear it alone.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.530
Oh,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.360
you truly take responsibility, milord.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.640
I have one more request.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.000
Could we untie the Marquis first?

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.480
Gently.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.400
Qingge.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.160
So you joined Heng in his mischief.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.150
I don't think Wang was being reckless.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.870
He must have his reasons for this.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.510
Abducting an imperial...

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.790
Gently.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.280
an imperial relative

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.210
could warrant death.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.940
Lord Sun.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.990
Are you still not acting?

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.270
Marquis, both sides are dear to me.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.590
Oh my.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.560
General Wang, you're rather forceful.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.840
Hmph.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.870
You seem eager to return to Chang'an.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.250
I'd say it's you who's in a hurry.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.480
Your thoughts, your longing, your hope.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.980
Why are you acting so jealous?

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.870
This Haihun Marquis Domain feels unsafe.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.800
Unsafe?

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.910
After this incident,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.680
I realized you are the greatest risk
to Haihun.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.200
Marquis,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.630
outside your mansion,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.330
you'll only find plain meals like this.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.710
Hmm, smells wonderful.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.800
Wang, come and eat.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.020
This has quite a wild charm to it.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.030
Wild charm, really?

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.760
Wasn't someone unwilling to come out?

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.650
Oh? And who might that be?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.640
That would be me.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.960
See, Lord Sun understands the situation.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.280
Mother, I want to eat this.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.200
I'm hungry.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.120
Drink some water
and the hunger will pass.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.960
Kid,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.550
come here.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.790
Sorry, milord.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.920
Slow down, there's more. Qingge.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.070
- Here.
- Thank you, milord.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.130
- Take this.
- Thank you.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.800
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.200
- Where are you from?
- Thanks.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.120
Where are you heading?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.520
We fled from Swan County

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.360
to Kangcheng.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.240
Fled?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.400
Why the need to flee?

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.760
The taxes were far too burdensome.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.350
We even paid tax just to breathe.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.850
We couldn't afford it anymore.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.680
Sun Liao!

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.590
- Mar...
- Listen carefully.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.550
Oh.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.640
Madam, take your time.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.180
I'd like to know more.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.025
At first, they tricked us, saying work

00:04:00.026 --> 00:04:01.620
at the Marquis's place would pay.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.540
Some said they went to dig for gold.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.050
Others were sent to build tombs.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.920
Either way, once gone,
no one ever came back.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.500
They took all the men.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.910
Now they're taking the women too.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.500
The magistrate in the village taxes

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.710
under every possible excuse.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.190
Even breathing costs tax.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.450
We couldn't pay anymore.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.240
So we fled in desperation.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.450
Must be that foolish Marquis
behind it all.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.000
I heard he's wealthy.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.480
His mansion is filled with gold.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.880
That's the price of our blood.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.050
That wretched Marquis

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.990
must've colluded
with the Western Regions folk.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.600
The men were tricked into going there.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.440
Western Regions folk?

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.150
Who is it?

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.660
He said the Marquis owns a gold mine.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.680
Follow him and you can mine for gold.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.760
Child.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.340
Here, buy some food.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.740
Milord, you are truly kind.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.680
Oh, don't say that.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.740
- On your feet.
- Thanks.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.110
- Up you get.
- Up.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.420
- Up.
- Thank you, milord.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.910
Get back on the road.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.830
Go on, keep moving.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.670
Much obliged, milord.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.750
I know nothing of these matters.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.590
Silence.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.250
Yes, I'll be silent.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.170
I'm not going to Chang'an.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.430
I can't just walk away now.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.420
I've told you before.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.920
It's dangerous for you to stay.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.190
And they're not in danger?

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.380
Then let Lord Sun handle it.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.230
No.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.930
Their suffering stems from me.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.070
They scolded me rightly.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.200
Every word rings true.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.220
(Tea)
I shall bear every insult and jeer.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.490
But I won't accept hollow survival.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.680
I know you worry about my safety.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.890
But since I still draw breath,

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.310
I cannot and will not

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.630
live on in ignorance.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.080
I will head east

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.720
to investigate in Swan County.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.710
Go back to Chang'an alone.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.080
Indeed, Lord Wang.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.090
I advise you to head back to Chang'an.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.760
I shall remain in Yuzhang

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.680
to protect the Marquis

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.940
and serve the people.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.360
That would be the perfect plan.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.840
Didn't I tell you to keep quiet?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.840
Yes, I'll keep quiet.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.160
Heng.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.950
Look at that young lady in red armor.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.870
Doesn't she look familiar?

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.400
De Jiu.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.440
De Jiu, what brings you to Yuzhang?

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.080
- Why...
- Wang Heng, take the decree.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.750
Decree to Commander Wang Heng.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.460
Xiqiang Tribe crossed the border

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.800
and intended to invade.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.880
Envoys were sent to placate them,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.200
but it only roused their anger,

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.500
leading to rebellion and plunder.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.680
Now, scouts report,

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.830
Xiqiang elites have slipped into Yuzhang,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.800
their intentions unclear,

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.190
yet they seem to stir unrest.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.510
I command Colonel De Jiu

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.720
to ride swiftly to Yuzhang

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.240
and assist Commander Heng

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.360
to investigate discreetly.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.160
I humbly accept it.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.520
Marquis,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.780
what is the meaning of this?

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.070
Eleven years ago,

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.630
because of me,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.280
the heroes of Wucheng Village
were all slain.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.400
With this kneel,

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.830
please accept it on behalf of

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.700
your Uncle Ren Xuan
and the fallen heroes.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.680
It was all a cruel twist of fate.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.490
Marquis, please rise.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.070
Greetings, madam.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.520
Senior.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.220
We haven't met in 11 years.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.400
Have you been well?

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.040
De Jiu,

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.250
it has been a long time.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.710
Your manners feel distant now.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.710
Well...

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.270
Long time no see.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.880
You've lost weight.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.200
Oh right, Qingge,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.630
I need to tell you something.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.950
Alright.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.670
Hey,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.910
what is it?

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.990
Even she has come.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.840
This is for you.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.770
Still thinking about my nephew's order?

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.150
I suspect Western Regions folks

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.680
are actually the Xiqiang vanguard.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.510
Your poisoning

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:39.970
was their doing.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.270
Then I must scout Swan County even more.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.150
No.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:43.990
No?

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.790
It's not up to us.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.320
Go ask them.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.030
It's been years since we last met.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.480
We should really catch up properly.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.340
Let's leave that matter

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.260
to tomorrow.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.330
- Fifteen, twenty.
- Fifteen, five.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.870
Fifteen, twenty.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.710
Five.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.270
Fifteen, twenty.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.140
Ten.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.190
Drink up.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.440
Fifteen, fifteen, twenty.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.280
Five.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.900
Your turn to drink.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.740
Twenty.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.400
Good thing there's a spare room.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.670
Why don't we have a drink?

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.560
Alright.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.110
Here.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.040
Here.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.550
Don't worry too much.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.580
His Majesty wishes to seek peace.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.420
He is seeking an envoy
to parley with Xiqiang.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.190
If the talks go smoothly,

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.550
the Great Han and Xiqiang
can avoid battle.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.010
Then Lord Yan wouldn't have
to join the army.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.920
I've thought it over.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.680
My father is now advanced in years.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.000
All these years,
I haven't been by his side,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.270
fulfilling my duty as a child.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.730
I plan to go to Chang'an tomorrow.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.030
Lord Yan will be overjoyed to see you.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.400
Thinking back on it,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.040
I haven't been to Chang'an
for many years.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.280
You've been there with Wang these years.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.120
How is your life?

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.080
Not long after you returned to Changyi,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.790
the Mansion was abandoned.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.570
He and I kept ourselves hidden there.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.630
He has remained in a coma.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.340
No need for

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.250
(Xu Pingjun, Empress)

00:10:46.251 --> 00:10:46.960
such formalities.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.530
Heng still shows no sign of waking.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:54.850
He's unconscious,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.980
with no sign of recovery.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.710
How are things

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.080
between you and His Majesty?

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.470
The same as before.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.180
When will His Majesty remove Huo Guang

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.120
to secure his throne?

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.080
His Majesty knows of your feud
with Lord Huo,

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.600
but he says Lord Huo's loyal
to the court.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.480
For the Great Han to prosper,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.440
he is indispensable.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.980
(Order)

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.780
(Order)

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.040
This is His Majesty's will.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.080
The post of Colonel
of the Huben Army is yours.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.480
Colonel of the Huben Army?

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.110
The heroes of Wucheng Village are gone.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.910
His Majesty is deeply saddened.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.030
This badge

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.520
is his way of entrusting
Uncle Ren and the Village.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.890
From this day on,

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.800
you will stand for their loyal souls,

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.360
guarding by His Majesty's side.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:39.800
But rest assured,

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.010
one day,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.870
His Majesty will restore their honor.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.740
- I...
- Not again.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.280
I will not fail His Majesty's trust.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.360
His Majesty wishes you to fight together.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.110
I've sent men to seek famous physicians

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.220
and will inform you when there's news.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.890
People of Baiyue use this
to treat hysteria.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.290
The effect is fierce.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:12.640
We can only give it a try.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.840
Much obliged.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.910
Fragrant sachets for sale.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.480
Fragrant sachets, come take a look.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.150
I came across this prescription.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.210
I'd trouble you with this.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.220
(Medical Prescription)

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.030
The remedies you bring
are stranger each time.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.370
All medicine carries some harm.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.600
Many are folk remedies,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.000
never truly tested or proven.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.060
They might harm the body instead.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.620
Look at me,

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.030
am I not perfectly fine?

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.100
You test them on yourself each time.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:49.940
It's okay.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.930
You truly are loyal and devoted.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.270
This person must mean a lot to you.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.370
Could he be the one in your heart?

00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:59.630
Please, much obliged.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.050
I've searched everywhere

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.040
for the remedy.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.720
I've tried every method there is,

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.670
yet he didn't wake up.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.240
Until one day...

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.550
In the Western Regions,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.240
a princess was framed

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.670
and her finger was pricked,

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.160
falling under a curse,

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.580
and slept for a hundred years.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.780
She was saved at last

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.360
by a fierce remedy.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.480
What remedy was that?

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.550
Breath Exchange.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.000
Come here.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.180
(Pharmacy)

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.530
(Been unconscious so long,
yet no better.)

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.790
(I guess I'll have to try that way.)

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.560
Forget it,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.750
a desperate cure.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.910
If you dare breathe a word of this,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
you're done for.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:07.960
And he's awake?

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.240
Awake just like that?

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.900
Waking up at this moment,

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.190
it's really a bit of a pity.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.040
Yes, quite a pity indeed.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.240
See? I told you.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.720
Pity I didn't give that man any money

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:22.970
and even knocked him out.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.850
That remedy was truly good.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.620
So by that logic,

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.820
you and Wang have weathered

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:31.670
hardships together.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.080
Yet he still doesn't know your feelings?

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.550
Perhaps it's better if he doesn't.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:43.720
De Jiu.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.270
That way, I won't expect anything.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.390
Without expectation, bonds last longer.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:50.700
What kind of reasoning is that?

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:52.960
Come on.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.770
May Wang one day understand your heart.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.280
Understand your heart?

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.010
What are you talking about?

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.450
My loyalty to His Majesty.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.630
There you go again, always His Majesty.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.500
Always trying to please those above.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.010
Involution.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.750
What does Wang mean by that?

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.280
Just the nonsense of a drunken man.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.480
It means nothing at all.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.180
Why is this still wine?

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.270
Where's the water?

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:31.310
Where's the water?

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:32.710
Ah!

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.480
Why did I sniff it again?

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.340
And I'm drunk all over again.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:42.570
Um...

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.060
I'll go check on the Marquis.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.350
Wang Heng.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:52.720
Wang Heng.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.320
Wang Heng.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.290
Wake up! Hehee!

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.680
Come on, we're setting off.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.290
Marquis, it's not even dawn yet.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.190
Rise early to seize the day.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.150
How was your sleep?

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.200
Do you understand?

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.430
The four of us...

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.080
No, five of us

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.080
should join forces for something great.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.510
I never agreed to that.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.240
I've already said,

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.150
you and Qingge return to Chang'an.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.520
Wang,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.760
let the Marquis investigate with you.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.380
I'll head to Chang'an alone.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.200
De Jiu told me,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.120
Xiqiang has rebelled.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.240
My father needs to join the campaign.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.390
It will be perilous.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.510
Heaven looks after the righteous.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.920
Lord Yan will return safely.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.110
So don't worry too much.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.400
Much obliged, Wang.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.440
But my father is quite old now.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.850
If I don't return this time,

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.760
who knows when we'll meet again?

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:16.670
Qingge.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.480
Wang.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.160
You know how the Marquis is.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.240
Once he decides, no one can sway him.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.150
Don't worry.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.880
Once this matter is settled,

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.550
I'll drag him back to Chang'an
if I must.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.500
I'll keep the Marquis safe all the way.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.630
Mm.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.240
I'll trouble you with this.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.080
Take care.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.430
Take care.
