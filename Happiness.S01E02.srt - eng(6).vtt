What's going on over there?

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.790
Did people die?

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.780
- What's going on?
- That makes no sense.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.850
How could that be?

Devour the land,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.330
or send pestilence among my people,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.310
if my people, who are called by my name humble themselves

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.340
and pray and seek my face and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.830
turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from Heaven,

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.290
and I will forgive their sin and heal their land.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.150
Now, my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.350
For now, I have chosen and consecrated this house–

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.460
One of the homeless people came down with pneumonia so they gave him medicine for it.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.240
It was donated so they didn't know it caused side effects.

From all over the world, the reports of an infectious disease

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.290
and have drawn the line, but similar incidents are happening domestically as well.
[Infectious disease that cause one to tear off people's flesh, suspicious incidents occur throughout the country]

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.380
At a homeless shelter in Seyang city, more than ten homeless people

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.830
have been found dead.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.190
The authorities say a random fight broke out among the homeless
[Suspicion of an outbreak, not deaths from a fight]

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.290
who were staying at the shelter, causing these deaths.

Sae Bom, are you all right?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.830
Yes, I was examined and got a physical.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.990
What in the world is going on here?

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.020
Do you know that your training has been put on hold?

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.340
The training site that Lee Jong Tae messed up has been completely shut down.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.270
Look. This is that guy, right?

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.180
Oh, yes. Gosh, he's pretty powerful, I guess.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.320
What if something really happens at this rate?

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.210
If people start going crazy like that all of a sudden,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.280
there is some medicine for treatment, isn't there?

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.190
I don't know. I think they're making an effort, but...

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.440
I got a call from reporter Ki Joo.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.180
He says he'll pay me if I tell him what happened here.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.350
Me, too. Gosh, he must've called all the team members.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.550
Hey. Don't talk to people like that.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.560
We signed the nondisclosure agreement.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.320
Right.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.720
- Are you back now?
- No.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.190
I'm on paid vacation, for six months.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.610
I packed up my stuff to move and sent them over. I stopped by to say hi.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.550
Are you leaving the civil servant dorm? You put a lot into decorating that place.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.820
I'm fine.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.870
I got my own place. An apartment.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.940
- A loan?
- No. Do you remember the score count I mentioned?

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.610
The special provision on a public rental and sales of housing program for police officers.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.190
I remember. Service evaluation and apprehension performance.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.840
Even though I got the highest score, it wasn't high enough.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.460
So I decided to get points for being a newlywed.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.800
Well, so... you're getting married because you're short on points?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.420
Yes.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.300
- To whom?
- A guy who asked me out when I was younger.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.100
I had rejected him,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.070
but I asked him if he was still interested.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.700
It's not because I think you're easy.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.590
I... have a dream of living in my own house.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.620
That's why.

So cold.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.270
- Are you short on points?
- That is true, but...

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.710
I'm saying this because I'm interested in you.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.260
You're pretty good-looking, and you're able to make a good living.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.490
Hey, I'm better than you think. Graduating from school two years late is not an issue at all!

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.690
On top of that, it's a brand-new apartment. You'll regret it if you miss this chance.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.230
Hey, there aren't a lot of decent people like me out there.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.430
Fine.

I'm asking you... to marry me.

It's not infected?

No. They want to draw my blood every two weeks.

How much can you give me?

I'll advertise very hard. What is it?

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:53.450
He's an infectious diseases specialist. There's a program that sends a few military academy cadets to medical schools.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.240
He got a specialist license through that program, then served as an army doctor and got discharged.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.730
After he was discharged, he worked for a pharmaceutical company.

It's a picture of him when he was on trial for assaulting a pharmaceutical company's CEO.

He didn't seem like that type of person.

Usually, the calm and gentle ones are scarier when they go crazy.

Well, you said the city hall could come

and check if we're really married.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.350
I guess we could explain why we got married with this.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.170
It's an intense motivation.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.900
Right, right. It looks like we have a story there.

- I'll go and pass these out–
- No. I'll go.

From here, the lower floors are for rent, and the upper floors are for general sale.

They blocked the door so people can't come up from downstairs.

- Are you going down?
- Yes.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:18.910
One unit is empty, and a lady lives in the other unit, but she didn't come home last night.

- What?

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.370
It's in violation of fire department regulations.

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.790
Look at me. I'm fine.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:04.190
If you get some rest after the test today, you should be fine.

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:08.710
I'll tell your wife that you're not having an affair.

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:13.680
I get scared when I think that I might be dying.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.510
Why would you be dying?

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:19.690
You didn't get bitten. Look at me.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:22.120
It's nothing. Really.

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:26.500
You'll get tested today, get checked out, then you'll be fine.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.430
I'll ask if you can get some bonus points.

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:41.310
You're not thirsty or anything, are you?

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.490
We have one more patient.

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:19.140
I'll take a look at your wound.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.510
Are you sure you got scratched?

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:41.070
It looks like it was slashed with a knife.

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:43.190
Pretty recently at that.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.610
I wish that was the case.

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.710
My wound wouldn't heal quickly, either.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:56.370
It doesn't look too serious.

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:58.480
Let me examine it.

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:01.710
My gosh.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.390
Does it look different if there is a problem?

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:06.200
The color.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.550
The cut area changes to dark red.

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:18.060
Please stay here until the test is completed.

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:22.340
Aren't you going to take these off?

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.990
That'll do, right?

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:45.810
Tell me if you get thirsty.

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:48.600
Yoon Sae Bom, come out for a minute.

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:57.110
I told you. I said you'll be fine.

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.540
I'll go and draw my blood. Stay here.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.790
I'm fine.

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:22.490
Nothing will happen.

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:25.220
I'll just make some money and go.

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.800
It's okay.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:57.210
If something like this happens again, tell me in advance.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.710
I don't want to be shocked.

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:05.050
I got it. Will you please open the bag?

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:23.640
I'm trying to be nice to you even though I don't like you.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.950
Do you know our trainee? The one that Lee Jong Tae bit.

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:48.150
I heard he's not doing well.

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:51.080
And that he refused to see his family.

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:03.210
If you're bitten, you get infected no matter what.

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:09.020
Your condition worsens, and the duration in your normal state shortens.

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:14.670
You never know when he'll get thirsty and will attack people. So, of course, he can't have any visitors.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.350
Is there a way to treat him?

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.900
As of now, there is no treatment.

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.090
Once they get worse, they are always thirsty.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:29.380
They become irrational and attack people whenever they see them.

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:35.190
What we can do for now is to slow down the deterioration.

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:41.930
Then it's true that no one leaves here alive.

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:49.720
You were extremely lucky, Yoon Sae Bom.

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:54.780
If all goes well, Lee Seung Hyun will be okay as well.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.740
Are you bored? Do you want to eat something?

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:26.860
Where are you right now?

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.870
I have a family.

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:35.700
If I die in vain like this, they'll keep my death a secret.

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.230
Sae Bom, there is a way

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:40.760
where my safety is guaranteed, and I can make some money.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.660
Hello? Hey, Lee Seung Hyun!

00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:01.290
The call is not going through. After the beep...

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:03.280
I wonder if they're doing okay there.

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.180
What if they all die there?

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.170
I got a call from reporter Ki Joo.

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:11.250
He says he'll pay me if I tell him what happened here.

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.090
He snuck out, wearing the hazmat suit inside out.

00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:32.890
They thought he was moving chairs.

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:36.490
Where do you keep the critical patients?

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.010
Where are they?

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.160
We isolated them in the low-temperature warehouse where the food ingredients are stored.

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:45.870
But we had to move them elsewhere since the number of people kept increasing.

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:48.480
So where is that exactly?

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.440
In the refrigerated truck.

You said he's in there. Why aren't we going in?

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.130
Someone is supposed to show up.

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:30.750
Who? Did you call for extra support?

00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:32.880
Here comes the tiger.

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:39.380

I'd like Sergeant Jung and me to meet the dealer. Are you okay with that?

00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:47.090
Yes, of course.

But what are we doing here?

00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.440
They were keeping the remaining Next inside the pharmaceutical company storage.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.520
I wanted to find out who distributed it on the market.

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:14.280
It looks like this infectious disease is causing havoc abroad, according to the news.

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.920
Did Next get sold globally?

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:22.140
I told you I'm not good at creating something, but I'm good at stealing it.

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:27.130
I stole that drug from abroad when I was part of the Competitive Edge team.

00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.330
How impressive.

00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:48.920

But where is Lee Jong Tae?

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:07.580
Lee Jong Tae, that asshole.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.000
You can't get in touch with him, right?

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.240
There are two.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.450
There are three.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.080
The drug.

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:38.130

Jerks, you're all dead.

What was that?

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:20.100
It's a Glock. Have you never seen one?

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:23.160
Why do you carry something like this!

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.030
What the hell are you doing?

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:35.100
Making sure he's dead.

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:39.580
Killing a person in front of a cop?

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:42.650

Hands up, everyone!

Hey! How many shots did you fire?

It's a good thing we're not in a residential area. You might get disciplined!

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.570
Did you fire all the shots?

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:22.130
Please!

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.840
When did he turn like that?

I don't know, s***!

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:43.050
I went inside the house to get the money from him, and he was like that. He bit his entire family and killed them.

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:47.230
He was banging his head in a puddle of blood.

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:48.740
Did he take Next?

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.360
He took a lot of it.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.330
He went totally mad, and he's been like that ever since.

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:55.000
And you did that to a sick person?

01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:58.260
Then what else should I have done?
