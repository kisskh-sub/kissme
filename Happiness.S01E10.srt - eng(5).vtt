Jung Yi Hyun.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.260
Does Sae Bom carry antibodies?

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.870
Unfortunately, no.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.630
Then why did you contact me out of the blue?

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.110
Why don't you let Seo Yoon out? On a humanitarian level,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.500
we decided to accept minors who are in a lockdown.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.530
The situation outside must be dangerous, too, though.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.450
She will be protected in the safest place possible.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.190
The only problem is getting her out of the building.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.990
Can I let Sae Bom leave with her?

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.450
If the two of them want to come out, we're ready to accept them,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.210
but they will have to cooperate with the work that I do.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.820
I'll contact you after discussing it with Sae Bom.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.490
Must you keep it a secret from Jung Yi Hyun, too?

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.670
Didn't something seem off?

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.950
He asked if Yoon Sae Bom could leave with Seo Yoon, even though he guessed it was dangerous out here, too.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.180
When he's the type to come out himself if it's a dangerous situation.

What are you doing?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.440
This was at Seo Yoon's place.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.980
I used to be a Jenga master back in school. Level 9 in Jenga.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.960
Ahjussi, would you like to play with us?

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.240
No, it's okay. I have to go up to the 15th floor.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.100
Later. Okay?

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.860
To see Sae Bom?

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.600
But you just saw her.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.730
I know. Well, I keep missing her, no matter how much I see her.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.160
Gosh, so annoying.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.020
Hey! There's a problem!

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.510
What is it?

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.220
This was on the table.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.590
I made an irreversible mistake.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.720
I was going to stay in my apartment and endure somehow,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.950
but I don't think I can anymore.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.680
I'm going to go outside the building and ask for help.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.700
Please divide the remaining food and water among the residents.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.220

Well, people's handwriting changes when they get anxious.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.440
We need a great detective.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.250
But do you believe it?

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.160
That he would go out and ask for help to divide the food among the residents?

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.800
It's weird.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.740
What could be the "irreversible mistake" he is talking about?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.490
How could he have done something wrong when he never left his place?

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.150
He could. The gym.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.320
Are you still thinking about that? He's not the type to take the drug.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.820
What is this?

[Lime]

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.680
Does he grow a vegetable garden, too?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.720
If you put that inside the toilet, it gets rid of the stench.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.840
I'm from the Special Operation Unit.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.360
We used it in field maneuvers.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.150
I see.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.720
What happened?

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.260
He does have tons of medicine.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.660
But these have all been authorized for use.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.210

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.900
Oh, seriously, here...

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.930
What? Were you two in there?

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.090
- What is the owner doing inside?
- What brings you two here?

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.200
Well, we wanted to continue our conversation from yesterday.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.190
Since everyone is having a hard time right now.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.060
- You got something from him.
- Oh, this is─

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.240
We all live in the building. Why not help each other out?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.800
We're talking to him right now

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.130
so please just wait and see.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.450
There's no sign of a break-in, and we found NEXT.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.160
"Irreversible mistake" might mean that he has been infected.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.070
I just don't know.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.320
He was happy just taking selfies by himself.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.000
I'm sure he would have stayed home even if he got infected.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.350
I mean, there is no way a homebody would've gone outside.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.100
Then where could Kim Se Hoon be?

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.120
Someone locked him up.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.380
What about the note regarding sharing his food?

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.390
He wrote that because he was threatened!

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.130
Or not?

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.100
He's not in his apartment, and the lobby door was left open.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.620
He really could have left.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.030
There are tons of soldiers guarding outside.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.620
He's got a lot of money. He could have had someone open the door for him.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.560
Please open the door!

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.390
Sir! I don't hear anything! Are you in there?

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.800
What are you doing right now?

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.770
You're here, too, Building Representative.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:09.000
Everyone asked me for some help.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.130
I heard the 15th-floor resident has lots of water.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.420
Wouldn't it be nice for him to share with his neighbors?

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.060
Gosh, that's what I mean.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.620
We're only asking to have a conversation.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.930
Someone saw the 15th-floor ahjussi leave the building.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.200
We should check whether or not he's infected.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.910
- Who saw him?
- Me.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.920
I saw him leave early this morning.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.560
Really?

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.330
Are you sure it was Kim Se Hoon?

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.170
I didn't see his face,

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:38.020
but he is the only one who wears a hazmat suit.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:50.530
I'm sorry, but we are running out of water. We do need to come up with a solution.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.630
And the second-floor people are asking for too much money.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.030
You had his keys!

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.600
She brought something out from this place in a shopping bag earlier, too.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.900
That was my stuff.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.860
It says to share whatever is here.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.020
The owner already gave his permission

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.290
so why didn't you say anything earlier?

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:41.430
More than that, what does he mean by "irreversible mistake"?

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.830
Did he have some legal issues?

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.060
Anyway, whoever gets the first dibs is the owner.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.500
Honey, take the water first.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.230
Please calm down.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.390
Let's share a bit of the food supply first.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.130
Not everything. Only some of it.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.830
We never know when Kim Se Hoon will return, and we need to leave some for those who are not here.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.860
Who says? Who do you think you are?

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.960
All right! I got it. Tell everyone to come.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.090
Look over here, Detective... call everyone over...

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.190
Call them over here. I got it. Let go of this.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.760
Gosh, so heavy.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.080
It's a relief we have water now.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.050
Let's leave the light on in the bathroom too.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.120
Oppa, what are you bothered about?

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.760
Hey, we only got this much.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.520
He had all kinds of survival equipment and things.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.580
But still, the 5th-floor detective distributed them fairly.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.830
Fairly?

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.620
If he really wanted to be fair, he should have set different levels.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.670
Shouldn't people who paid tons of money to live here get more?

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.640
Isn't that common sense?

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.800
- What nonsense are you spewing?
- Right...

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.090
But that guy on the 5th floor, didn't he seem weird today?

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.540
He stuck close to his wife.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.490
He must love her a lot.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.220
Oppa...

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.480
- you love me a lot, too, right?
- Hey, don't get too close. It's hot.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.760
There were tons of food on the 15th floor, right?

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.460
Yes. The place was huge, too.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.200
He had so many strange things, too.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.890
What are you looking at?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.250
- What brings you two here?
- Unit 1501.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.560
The owner disappeared, and only his things are there. Wouldn't it be a waste to let all that sit?

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.730
The apartment residents are suffering due to a shortage of daily essential items.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.300
Hey, go out for a sec.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.700
- Do you want me to go out?
- Then do you think I should?

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.490
Go out.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.890
Hurry.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.670
Come in.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.080
So Kim Se Hoon went outside, right?

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.640
Probably. He is not inside the building.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.220
He must have been lonely.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.050
I saw on TV about people dying alone.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.730
Since he doesn't have any family or friends.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.930
I'm sure that's why he went outside.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.170
Since my mom and dad are together, they should be fine, right?

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.660
Of course.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.240
We would have been in bad shape without you, too. We would have been so lonely.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.220
Your dimples!

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.590
Here.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.560
Thanks.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.870
Isn't it spicy?

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.920
You eat spicy food so well.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.730
Do you dip that much sauce?

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.000
- Isn't it spicy?
- No.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.550
It looks spicy.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:29.020
[D+5]

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.620
Ahjussi.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.900
Ahjussi.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.730
Oh? What is it?

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.010
Hyun isn't here. When did he leave?

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.790
I don't know.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.440
Do you also miss Hyun, no matter how much you see him?

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.070
Go back to sleep.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.580
I've been there, done that.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.180
Should we get married?

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.600
I wanted to have a herringbone pattern for the floor,

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.770
but I don't feel right about tearing apart the new floor.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.590
Still, this is clean and simple.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.700
I can't believe it.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.650
A place of my own.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:23.650
♫ Like the thousands of days I’ve spent ♫

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.860
I thought I was in here alone.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.510
♫ And I know I’ll keep going ♫

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.490
♫ Keep dreaming, and keep loving ♫

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:42.550
♫ Not knowing what lies ahead, ahead ♫

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.540
♫ Sometimes life gets so hard ♫

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.300
♫ Feels like there’s no one else ♫

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:58.480
♫ But myself against the world, the whole world ♫

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:04.320
Hey, where did you go? Why aren't you sleeping?

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.910
Yes, well...

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.160
Is the radio working?

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.990
Give it to me.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.090
Colonel Han Tae Seok.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.960
Colonel Han.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.890
- Hey, Han Tae Seok.
- He must be sleeping.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.340
What did you talk about?

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.850
Did he say I have the antibodies?

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.030
You don't.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:41.990
I knew it.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.650
I've never even won the smallest lottery before,

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.250
but I'm relieved that I didn't get the disease.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.940
Hey! Did your cut open up again?

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.830
No, it didn't. It's gotten much better.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.920
What do you mean? You'll suffer more if it gets infected.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.130
Oh, hey...

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:24.450
♫ I know you can only see the light in the dark ♫

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.360
It does look a lot better.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.330
I told you. I'm human vitamin and antibiotics.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.400
You didn't get hurt anywhere else, did you?

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.220
- If you do, just tell this noona.
- Okay, Noona.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.930
That's right.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.280
What did Han Tae Seok say to you?

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.460
Oh, he said he would let Seo Yoon leave.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.440
He says he'll accept her on a humanitarian level.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.100
- Really?
- Yes.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.250
- And?
- I told him I would talk to you about it first.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.960
I see.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.820
Wouldn't it be dangerous outside?

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.550
So I was thinking, what if you go out with her?

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.050
If you're with her, Seo Yoon would feel better, too.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.000
Then we should all go out together.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.730
You should get some antibiotics out there, too.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:15.460
I don't think Seo Yoon should go out right now.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.460
We have to know what's going on outside for sure.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.790
Oh, right.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.360
Kim Se Hoon. Did he say he's out there?

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.730
Not officially.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.590
He said someone could have gotten him out. He said he would look into it.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.220
I was thinking

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.930
he could be in here.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.830
But we looked throughout the apartment building.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.000
There's a spot we haven't looked at yet.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.790
He was planning on leaving, but the soldiers and the infected scared him

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.340
so he came back in.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.490
He is hiding in here right now.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.850
I doubt he knows the passcode.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.320
We should still check.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.790
Sae Bom.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.200
Was it good?

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.590
You're the best.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:01.630
You two, that's enough. Come out.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:16.190
You just need to keep that in mind.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.820
I was just giving her some legal counsel.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.350
Don't do it in places where there isn't anyone around.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.530
You know, legal counsel.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.690
If you sneak around, you might bump into an infected person.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:32.320
Will you keep our secret?

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.640
You should tell your wife yourself first.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.010
Once the trust is broken between a married couple, it won't last long.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.650
Can we leave now?

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:48.410
You two, don't come here ever again.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.860
Hold on. Take this with you.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.030
This isn't ours.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.360
Kim Se Hoon?

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.880
Kim Se Hoon?

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.620
Do you hear me?

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:44.720
Are you doing this because of your thirst?

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.720
- This powder─
- It's lime.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.920
The one that was in Kim Se Hoon's home.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.810
Oh Joo Hyung. Are you really a doctor?

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.910
Can you come out? There's someone I need you to look at.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.060
My license has been suspended.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.460
Who is it?

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.650
Who's sick?

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.840
You'll find out if you follow me.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:18.760
We really have no idea. I was just giving her legal counsel.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.650
You don't need to tell me about that anymore. Just tell me the circumstance of when you came in here.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.920
Did you sense anything strange when you came in?

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.350
Well. I don't really remember.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.830
Did you not go into the main bedroom?

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.790
No. We went in. We did, but... How could I put it?

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:15.320
It smelled like cement, and flies were flying around. So, we left right away.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.960
If we knew there was a body here, we never would've come.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.470
Do you think that we're murderers?

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:26.190
I'm an attorney. Please recognize that I'm not that stupid.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.950
What about Hyung Jung Gook?

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:32.170
I told him the situation. He'll bring the others.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.680
What are you doing here?

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.150
Over here.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:41.120
Please wait here.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.110
Oh!

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.400
[Do Not Enter. Danger of Infection!]

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:03.180
What are you looking at?

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.150
I feel a bit better when I look at this.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.910
I can't become a shameful dad.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:20.590
Gosh. I only took a quick glimpse, but it used up so much battery.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:32.030
But don't you need this in order to write?

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.470
I can use a pen and paper.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:39.400
That's the beauty of being a writer. It doesn't cost money.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.280
Thank you.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:47.220
I'm always receiving things from you.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.100
As your older brother, I don't know what to say.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.900
Hyun Kyung, even still...

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.090
If something happens to me,

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:02.320
can you take care of my family for me?

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.560
I can't do that.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.150
Just focus on staying healthy and getting out of here.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:10.170
Hey. I'm sick. I'm sick.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.170
I'm asking you for this favor.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:16.080
You must feel a lot better now! Much better!

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:20.860
Hello.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:24.180
Yes, hello.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.480
You gave me food last time.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.530
- I'm returning the favor.
- I see.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.980
Wow. What is this?

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.960
What?

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.640
Is it okay for you to give me all this?

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.930
Of course. This is all mine.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.720
I see you guys were here.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:56.120
I think you need to follow me to the 11th floor.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.290
Why? What's wrong?

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:02.580
Well. Someone died.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.000
What? Who?

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.630
What are you doing to me so early in the morning?

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.950
It shocked me! How annoying!

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.510
You're the only doctor in this apartment building.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:21.510
Then you should have told me what was in there.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.780
Wait a minute. What the heck? Are you suspicious of me?

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.930
Did you think that I killed that woman and that's why you put me in that room?

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:30.460
Well, it looks like you didn't.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.290
Since you're such a good liar–

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:33.790
Do you think I'm a murderer?

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:39.250
Never mind. Please tell us your opinion as a doctor.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.780
She got her neck bitten and died.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.620
Her neck area was totally bitten off. Geez, the stench...

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.880
Don't you have a more professional opinion?

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:53.510
Professional? By looking at the solidification of the blood and the stiffness of the body,

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:56.350
it's been more than two days since her death.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:58.490
The killer tried to eliminate the odor by spreading the powdered lime on the body.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:02.730
The powdered lime from the 15th floor, right?

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.070
Seriously, gnats. Damn!

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:08.630
These are the first things that swarm a dead body.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.900
To lay their eggs in the eyes and nose.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.610
This is why being alive is better than being dead, even if you're rolling around in a field of dog poop.

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.770
Please go and explain what happened to the others.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.430
Don't talk about the gnats.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.600
That really scared me. Geez.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.750
But did the two of them find the corpse first?

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.270
Together?

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.090
- That's a misunderstanding, Oh Joo Hyung–
- Oh!

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:37.030
I had a strange feeling so I asked him to come here with me.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:40.590
In my dream, the cleaning lady was sobbing...

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.360
I'm being honest!

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.070
- I'm so sure.
- Come on.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.120
No, no, I'm okay.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.910
I'm really okay, but I'm worried about you, Attorney.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:55.540
Your wife will be extremely shocked. Don't you think?

00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.400
Superhero, that bastard betrayed us!

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:05.340
Detective, Andrew ran away with all our food.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.690
Isn't this considered getting caught in the act?

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.020
Shouldn't you arrest him right away?

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.510
Please calm down. A person died.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:16.000
That's not important right now. Our food is gone!

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.880
The cleaning lady who used to stay with you died!

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.370
Ms. Lee Duk Soon!

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:24.540
Seriously...

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:29.490
I checked the corpse, and it looks like an infected person killed her.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.540
Her neck was bitten off.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.870
The 15th-floor ahjussi must've done it. It was written in his note.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.050
"Irreversible mistake."

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.390
You're right.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:45.770
That was his confession!

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:49.780
Then we can share the remaining food, right?

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.520
There's still no proof that says Kim Se Hoon did it.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.860
Then who else could it be?

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.190
There are no other infected inside the building.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:03.970
Now, now, there's a victim and a runaway so we can naturally narrow down the culprit.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.980
Since you're a Detective, you must know it well, Jung Yi Hyun.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.760
We need to investigate further.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.910
Especially, how the victim left the second floor and ended up being discovered here.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.780
I'll listen to the two of your witness statements at a later time.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:34.460
Honey... the corpse was so scary.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.720
Unit 1102 is a crime scene and is closed off for now.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.020
Also, know that the passcode was changed.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.020
When will you distribute the food from the 15th floor?

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:49.150
I told you that jerk Andrew ran off with our food!

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:53.140
Sae Bom, Hyun, I brought Ahn Guk Jin and the writer.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.070
- This is so far!
- What happened?

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.940
Has the cleaning lady really passed away?

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.820
You thieving bastard!

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.730
You!

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.140
Let go of me! You jerk!

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.190
Honey, you're going to kill him!

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.790
What's wrong with you?

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.600
Are you okay?

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.070
Young In!

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.660
Young In!

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.090
Her episode won't end.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:31.000
How about the tranquilizer?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.210
I injected the maximum amount possible. Her body can't bear much more.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.320
There is a sample remaining from Yoon Sae Bom's blood plasma treatment, right?

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.580
We have one left, but the head office is supposed to take it.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.590
They asked us to send over all the drugs in clinical trials.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.690
Colonel!

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.080
You said you would keep it a secret from Yoon Sae Bom.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.470
If you take the treatment, the higher-ups will sense how important it is!

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.480
I know that, too.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.900
Leave that here.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.710
Lower your gun.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.760
Lower your gun!

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.210
Calm down!

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:46.390
We're all on the same side, and Colonel Han Tae Seok is in charge here.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:49.940
Check with the prime minister's office.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.930
He's doing what's necessary right now.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.220
Everyone, step away.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.470
Check her condition and report to me right away if there are any issues.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:29.120
The head office will find out what just happened.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.560
The fact that you kept it a secret from Yoon Sae Bom, too.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.690
- We can report to them first.
- What?

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:41.060
Report to the head office that Yoon Sae Bom carries antibodies. Also, that the treatment is effective after experimenting on my wife.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:41.960
Then...

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.570
Tell them I'll bring out Yoon Sae Bom sometime tomorrow.

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:49.920
That will only earn you some time. The higher-ups will be suspicious of you.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.670
That's what I need. Time.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.760
Andrew is the last person who saw her. No one has seen her since then.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.910
That's around the suspected time of her death too, right?

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.820
It means she was attacked on her way upstairs.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:15.130
But do you think Kim Se Hoon did it?

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.160
Sae Bom, give me some water.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:25.400
I'm exhausted.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.720
Wow, I'm totally working out here.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.460
I'm so thirsty.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.510
I'm so thirsty. Thank you, thank you.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.400
How are other residents doing?

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.220
They're all having fits. Asking me why we're not doing anything when we know Kim Se Hoon did it.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.930
They want to break into unit 1501 and share the rest of the food.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:03.480
Let's go. The people will get worked up even more if we stay quiet.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.930
I just sat down...

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.620
We are only sharing the food. You can't take anything else.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.900
And you never know so we'll leave some of the food behind.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.940
We'll distribute them based on the headcount per family, so come in one at a time.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.640
Come in.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.500
If it's based on headcount, shouldn't we get Andrew's share too?

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.140
We can just take some for him.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.990
You said based on headcount. We can take Andrew's, right?

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.170
We can just take it.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:43.590
But shouldn't they give us Andrew's share, too?

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.660
Why won't they give it to us? He took so much from us.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.020
I won't let them get away with this. Wait and see.

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:53.920
How could he clean out our food like that?

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.950
Is Dong Hyun here?

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.230
Oh? Well...

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:45.500
He came by and left.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:50.660
I carried these heavy things all by myself.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.270
So Yoon, So Yoon. That woman...

00:38:56.270 --> 00:39:01.660
like I said, I was giving her a consultation somewhere quiet.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.810
Stop it.

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:08.260
I can't stand to listen to you anymore.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.770
Can I really stay here?

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:21.290
Temporarily. Don't go around for no reason.

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:23.320
The second-floor ahjussi is waiting for a chance to get you.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:28.560
But he won't come up here to the 15th floor. It's too far.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.470
Thank you. I'll stay here until Kim Se Hoon comes back.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.940
If he comes back, that is.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.820
Get some rest.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:41.520
Take off those goggles when you're alone. You must feel so stuffy.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.630
Stay inside the house as much as possible.

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:43.260
Seo Yoon. Seo Yoon!

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.080
What's wrong, Seo Yoon?

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.440
Seo Yoon, do you have chest pain?

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.520
What's wrong?

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.930
I just had a coughing fit.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.690
When I do this, I feel better.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.020
But why are you coughing while hiding?

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.340
Do you have any medicine?

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:18.860
I get a shot if I go to the hospital, but it hurts a lot.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.310
I'll be fine if I cough for a little bit.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:40.380
I guess it would be better to let Seo Yoon leave.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:44.010
No matter how dangerous it may be outside, there are doctors and medicine.

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:46.860
I'll talk to Han Tae Seok.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.880
Don't worry too much.

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:11.830
I'm sure my husband would want me to do something for the building.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.310
He worried about everyone until his last moment.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:25.030
You all know that the infected killed the cleaning lady, right?

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.970
The infected might still be inside, so everyone should be careful.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.360
Please limit going out of your apartments as much as possible.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:36.250
If possible, go around as a group of two or more.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:42.800
From now on, it would be best to discuss as a group on securing the building and checking for the infected.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:49.220
My husband, too... if only we had found out earlier...

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:58.030
More than anything, we should be proactive about finding who got infected.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:03.850
We should also convince the residents who have locked themselves up in their units to come out and test them.

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:08.770
Yes, we should. We need to find the infected.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.750
Whose blood should we drain today?

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.790
Do we have to pick a name out of a hat?

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:19.680
I think you should just do it.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.940
No, a doctor should do it.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.240
That's why you run a hospital, where you bleed people!

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.880
Don't do this!

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.270
Stop it!

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.930
You'll really hurt someone, Ahjussi!

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.850
Stop it!

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:50.230
He's attacking me!

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:54.950
Everyone, shouldn't we discuss food and water first?

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.550
Let's hear your opinion.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.820
We're thinking about going outside.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:04.000
If Kim Se Hoon from the 15th floor did indeed leave the building, it means there's a way out.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.530
We'll go out and see whether we can bring back food or water.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:10.830
If you go down to the underground level, there's an emergency power source.

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:15.590
Rather than going outside dangerously, if you go down and turn on the emergency power source,

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:20.730
we'll have electricity to cook with, and the water will gush out again, too.

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:26.750
Unit 103. There is an emergency switch-over in the electrical room beneath the senior citizen center.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.960
It was for the purpose of turning on the emergency light inside the elevator.

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:33.670
If you turn on the power for the entire building, the apartment electricity and water will turn on.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:38.740
More than that, honestly speaking, you two might go outside

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:41.970
and not come back.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.020
Oh, that's true. You're right.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:48.270
Detective Ahjussi, you were close to that soldier.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:55.500
As Oh Joo Hyung said, I think it would be good to resolve this from inside.

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:05.250
Then let's do that.

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:09.730
We'll go down and turn on the emergency power source.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:22.260
Oh Joo Hyung, how did you know about the emergency power source?

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.040
That's common knowledge for anyone who lives in an apartment building.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:30.170
I know you hate me, Ahjumma, but this is an emergency situation. A crisis.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:33.950
So let's look at the big picture and work together.

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:38.670
People should be civilized, first and foremost.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:43.670
Are you really going to go to the electrical room?

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:48.210
It does seem a bit suspicious, but it's necessary.

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.130
That's true, but...

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:53.460
It's a chance for Seo Yoon to leave, too.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:57.750
Before we go down to the electricity room, let's send her out first.

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.260
What are you going to tell her?

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.230
We can keep it a secret for now.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:06.910
If we tell her she's going alone, she might say no.

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:12.060
True. She can be so mature sometimes.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:17.130
Going down is one thing, but how will you come back up?

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:20.750
Remember he said it's extremely loud when the electricity is turned on?

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:23.960
When the infected hear the noise, they'll swarm over.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:30.860
They'll follow you to this building. If they get through the entrance, it might get even more dangerous.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.620
I can take a different route to come up.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:36.050
Let's go.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:43.820
[D+6]

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:48.260
Sleep more.

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:06.080
Have the infiltration team on standby. We're going in if I don't hear from them by the morning.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:09.290
The proportion of severely mutated patients in the apartments is high.

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:13.390
If we enter without pre-arranged setup, there will definitely be casualties.

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.370
As long as Yoon Sae Bom is safe, it doesn't matter.

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.930
Colonel Han Tae Seok.

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:20.860
Did you decide?

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.240
Sae Bom and Seo Yoon,

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.390
I will send them out.

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:31.080
We'll go down to the underground parking lot at 1 p.m. Please get ready to take them with you.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:35.280
What about you? Aren't you coming out?

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.650
Someone has to watch the house.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:44.660
We may have differences in opinion, but I know you genuinely tried to stop the Madness Rabies.

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:54.800
Please help Sae Bom and Seo Yoon so they can live safely.

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.740
Jung Yi Hyun has been infected.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.930
That's why he wants Yoon Sae Bom out of there.

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.800
See?

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:55.650
Let's play one more time.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:57.370
Again?

00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:00.110
Until I win.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:16.690
- Hyun.
- Yes?

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:18.820
Give me a moment.

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:32.690
Oh, I spoke to Han Tae Seok, and he said the soldiers are coming to the underground parking lot.

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:36.420
We can send Seo Yoon away with them and head over to the electrical room.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.500
You keep going around with stuff on your face again.

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:47.820
Do you remember what we talked about?

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.770
That we would tell each other if we're sick.

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:56.160
If I get thirsty and want to bite people,

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.760
I'll be sure to tell you.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:05.580
So tell me if anything happens to you.

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.550
Are you okay?

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:14.030
Of course, I'm okay. Why?

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:16.610
Are you worried that my cut is infected?

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:19.820
I've been thinking...

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:25.410
Your cut on your hand healed too fast.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.790
You didn't even drink water.

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:33.920
It does look a lot better.

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:39.110
I told you. I'm human vitamin and antibiotics.

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:41.810
Hey. It's not true!

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:44.480
It's still throbbing a lot.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.160
See?

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:51.290
I didn't realize it because I was in shock after seeing Lee Duk Soon's corpse.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:53.530
But I guess it opened up again.

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:58.390
What a relief.

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:01.150
I was so worried.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:04.110
Then you should've told me. Why worry?

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:07.000
How can I not worry? We don't even have any medicine.

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:13.260
What if it becomes infected? I told you to be careful!

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.210
I got it.

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:17.550
I'll be careful from now on.

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.330
Hey!

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:29.880
Colonel Han, I know you're there.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:35.000
Be sure to have plenty of antibiotics, antiseptics, and bandages.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.870
Hyun got hurt.

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:41.990
I'll have them ready.

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:46.270
It's nice to hear your voice.

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:51.660
How is Kim Se Hoon? You have to be careful since he might be infected.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:57.130
Kim Se Hoon isn't outside. There's a good chance he's still inside the complex so be careful.

00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:03.050
Once he tastes blood, he'll continue to go after humans.

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:04.930
Thank you.

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:10.230
Let's look for Kim Se Hoon again.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.860
Let's do that.

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.120
Ahjussi, don't open the door for anyone.

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.400
Kim Se Hoon might still be in the building.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.170
Okay, don't worry. I have my gun.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.210
- We'll be back.
- Okay.

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:42.860
Kim Se Hoon could still be inside.

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:48.820
I mean, some people make bunkers. There could be a secret space inside.

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.440
There's no way.

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:55.800
He really could still be inside. We don't even know the layout of this place.

00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:59.390
Andrew?

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:28.250
Can't we have Seo Yoon leave first and investigate after that?

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:30.950
What if someone gets hurt again?

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:36.720
I'll look for Andrew on my way down. You look around here.

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.390
Okay.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.200
Yoon Sae Bom, can you hear me?

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:59.870
Lieutenant, it's nice to hear from you, but I'm kind of busy right now.

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:02.160
Sae Bom, this is important.

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:08.120
I received the background check on the apartment residents, and there's something strange.

00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:22.210
[EPS/TPS]

00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:54.880
Ahn Guk Jin was found dead in his apartment.

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:00.770
[ID: Ahn Guk Jin]

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:03.170
Oh, I erased it.

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:09.390
Due to Madness Rabies, administrative judicial services are on pause.

00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:12.980
It took a while for the report to reach us.

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.940
How about his face?

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.170
Does he have a scar?

00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:46.980
No, not at all.
[Background check: Ahn Guk Jin]

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:53.630
Is it very dangerous in there?

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:01.410
It will take four to five hours until the troops go in. Stay home until they arrive.

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:03.950
We'll take care of everything when we get there.

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:11.700
Yoon Sae Bom, are you listening?

00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:21.800
[Kim Se Hoon]

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:42.040
[Sanitation worker: Lee Duk Soon]

Kim Se Hoon... I found him.

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.520
Wait a minute.

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.780
Do it slowly. Relax.

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:11.550
What's going on?

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:15.390
I saw Kim Se Hoon. Hurry and open the door. He might chase after me.

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.390
Is he having an episode?

00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:34.540
I'll tell you if we need help, so wait.

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:53.130
What are you doing? It's your turn.

00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:17.810
What are you doing right now?

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:26.670
My husband died because of you two.

00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:52.300
Hyung!

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:55.060
Hyung! Hyung, wake up!

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:57.300
It's me, Hyun.

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.110
Who are you?

I have a suggestion for you.

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:05.070
About a way to get rid of the people you don't like.

I know who you are.

01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:11.780
Turn on the power and come back. I'll let Seo Yoon and the detective leave.

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:15.110
The infected will swarm over!

01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:20.570
We'll survive and get out. And we'll arrest all those people.

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:24.430
Stop Yoon Sae Bom if she gets out again. Jung Yi Hyun has been infected.
