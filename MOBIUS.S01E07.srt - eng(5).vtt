Mom.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.390
I've learned how to make

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.650
your favorite stir-fried crab noodles.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.240
I tried making them the other day.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.950
They were delicious.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.600
Please wake up.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.860
I'll make them for you.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.110
Dr. Chen.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.920
The condition...

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.390
Remains the same, right?

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.640
An Lan.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.030
We can't rush this.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.470
I know your current research

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.870
is somewhat related to
your mother's condition.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.790
I've read many

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.760
of your papers.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.150
But from my clinical experience,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.200
miracles

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.920
don't happen that easily.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.510
The results of genetic research

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.370
might take generations to achieve.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.980
You need to face reality.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.000
I understand.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.350
The 24-hour EEG monitoring

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.850
is really unnecessary in my opinion.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.160
Let's change it to once every two weeks.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.600
That would be easier on your mother
as well.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.590
I hope you can accept the fact that

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.470
she has long since

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.450
lost all higher brain function.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.000
Give me more time.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.170
This is what my mother would want too.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:42.900
I know that.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.860
All right then.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.960
After such a major incident,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.460
why not cancel the speech?

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.090
There are some things that,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.810
as long as

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.000
I'm still alive,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.280
must go on.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.560
An executive of a company

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.520
that's seeking to go public was killed,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.030
almost all the potential investors

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.310
pulled out overnight,

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.960
and the rest are all just waiting
to see what happens.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.800
But if, at a time like this,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.460
I can still stand on the stage,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.260
if I can still crack a joke,

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.960
then it shows that Moma hasn't fallen yet.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.120
So I have no choiceâ€”

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.580
I have to carry on as usual.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.720
I know it's really hard on you, Qi.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.800
Getting paid a policeman's salary,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.400
yet dragged into
this deadly business with me.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.710
Have you considered

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.360
that all this chaos

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.480
might be a trap set by Squid to kill you,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.270
in which case by insisting on
giving the speech,

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.870
it might end up involving
many innocent lives?

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.880
Then what should I do?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.600
Should I just not come to the company,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.510
hide at home,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.430
and just let Moma Group collapse?

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.500
Is that what you suggest?

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.480
What about all those Moma employees?

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.830
Aren't they innocent too?

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.630
Squid's goal

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.390
is to stop my genetic research.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.360
Do you know what the ultimate success
of RAN technology

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.310
would mean?

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.720
It would mean

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.560
we can save more lives!

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.170

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.770
Could it be because of
the shock this morning?

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.920
I'm sorry.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.560
My emotions were a bit...

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.180
A bit...

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.430

I have a slight cough.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.140
No worries.

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.270

it's a waste of time.

Okay, An Lan.

Dr. An.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.240
Have you ever dreamed about
your own death?

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.160
I have.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.080
I have, too.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.270
Me, too.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.070
So how did you die?

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.270
Sometimes I got shot,

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.390
sometimes I died in explosions.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.850
I also died in explosions.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.130
Me too, in explosions.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.380
Looks like we're all afraid of dying.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.680
Don't you think
Boss isn't afraid of death?

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.410
That's true.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.070
I find your boss very strange.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.070
How so?

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.870
Why do you say that?

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.190
Don't you think he keeps giving

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.830
bizarre orders?

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:38.560

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.830
Like early this morning,

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.360
he suddenly called an emergency meeting.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.870
During my recent investigation,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.810
I found someone named Ye Kun

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.920
who is very suspicious.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.430
So,

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.120
Peishan, help me look into this.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.070
There were three Ye Kuns,

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.430
but he identified the right one
immediately.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.030
Which one?

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.520
This one.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:53.159
It's him.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.050
And he even

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.950
pulled out a photo of Ye Kun

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.600
directly from his pocket.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.920
Find this person for me today.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.750
How did he do that?

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.720
Does he have a printer in his pocket,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.240
or can he plug wires into
the back of his head?

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.750
Doesn't that happen all the time?

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.120
And that Fortune Bank robbery case
you're investigating.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.600
He knows too many details about it,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.720
as if he planned it himself.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.800

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.120

Besides, I wouldn't understand
anything anyway.

And then?

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.540
I went to see my mother.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.960
Why did you suddenly go there?

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.960
Because

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.930
I discovered something

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.440

Dr. Chen,

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:41.840
is it possible

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.750
that her brain has awakened

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:44.910
but her body hasn't?

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.460
Have you encountered such cases before?

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.150
Five years ago,

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.000
I did have such a patient.

unable to move.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.480
to awaken

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:07.440
her body too.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.720
What way?

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:18.490
I can't tell you

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.030

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.770
It's just my old condition acting up.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.660
But seriously, An Lan.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:27.980
From now on,

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.590
I really need you

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.450
to stand by my side and support me.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.050
From now on, in Moma,

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.290
you will be my right-hand person.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.160
Before we came out,

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.560
I had officially signed your appointment.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.920
No matter what objections or arguments

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.720
that guy Han Yufei has

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.920
at the board meeting,

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:45.350
he's insignificant.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.470
As long as I believe in you,

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.680
that's the final decision.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.160
Of course,

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.830
you need to believe in me too.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.400
Hello, teachers.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.310
Hello, students.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.680
I'm your student and alumnus,

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:16.490
Mo Yuanzhi.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.090
You go out first.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.510
Okay.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.610
He's all yours now.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.520
Who ordered you to kill Mo Yuanzhi?

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:14.880
On October 25

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.230
and November 26th,

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.240
where were you?

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.550
I forgot.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:25.350
You forgot?

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.260
Then who's this?

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.830
You also killed Moma executives

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.360
Han Song and Tang Shaorong.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.840
Why did you kill them?

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.760
Who ordered you to kill them?

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.000
I didn't kill him.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.310
I was just passing by.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.000
Passing by?

00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:59.400
You knew exactly

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.030
when the billboard would fall,

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.490
and you knew exactly
what would happen next.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.440
But I know it wasn't your own plan.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.260
Who's behind this?

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.160
What are you looking at?

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.790
Waiting for the time?

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.160
Waiting for 12 o'clock?

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.520
How do you know about 12 o'clock?

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:31.680
Who told you?

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.850
What did they tell you?

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.790
Did they say that
once it passes 12 o'clock,

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.450
everything would start over?

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:39.720
Or that after 12 o'clock,

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.920
you'd enter the loop?

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.200
Loop?

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.070
What loop?

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:48.590
Some people might think

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.480
that "defying fate"

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.110
sounds somewhat sacrilegious.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.840
That's fine.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.110
Let me and my team

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.880
take on this sacrilegious task.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.440
We'll take

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.440
the blame for it.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.160
I just hope

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.510
that when we succeed,

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.550
all of us

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:00.590
can experience...

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.520
Why are you here?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.960
Didn't Boss ask you to watch that person?

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.160
That person is fine.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.760
Wang Haoxin is watching him.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.030
I'm here to support you.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.790
If it's considered sacrilegious,

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.960
then I, Mo Yuanzhi, am doing exactly that!

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.680
So what?

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:13.960
Bravo!

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.830
Bravo!

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.640
Nice!

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:35.590
Are you done?

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.350
Just a minute.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.200
He didn't even tell you about the loop?

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:53.510
For the first two cases,

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.750
he might have helped you get away with it.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:55.750
But what about today?

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.960
How can he help
when you're caught red-handed?

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:58.510
Aren't you curious

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.570
how he knows about these time points?

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.340
Aren't you curious
what he's hiding from you?

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.870
Is there any point in
taking the blame for him?

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.200
I know exactly what you did!

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.520
I also know exactly
how you committed the crimes.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.360
Because he and I are
the same kind of person.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:17.990
You and him...

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.740
Are the same kind of person?

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.480
Who is he?

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:47.750
What about now?

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.200
You Yuxiang?

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:55.590
You Yuxiang?

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.510
You Yuxiang!

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:12.350
Fang Lu.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:13.790
You Yuxiang is gone.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:15.480
Be careful!

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:26.400
Boss,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.590
You Yuxiang is gone.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.550
Boss.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.030
About that professor you asked me

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.030
to look up this morning, You Yuxiang,

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.560
I found something unusual.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:43.530
Go ahead.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.440
He's dying.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.000
What?

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.030
A month ago,

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.000
he was diagnosed with
a malignant brain tumor,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.530
already in its final stage.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:55.270
At that time, the doctors said

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.670
he had two months to live,

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:57.790
which means

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.660
he only has one month left now.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.030
A life for a life.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.390
Is it worth it?

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.750
Where would a man

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.350
who isn't afraid of death go?

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.030
Tang Xin.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.800
Pretending not to see me?

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.750
Mr. Han.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.880
Mr. Han?

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.480
So formal?

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.100
Talk properly.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:20.590
Yufei.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.480
Why would I pretend not to know you?

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.350
Right.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.920
You used to come to my house often
when we were kids.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.790
Remember?

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.880
Our families used to get together
all the time.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.110
And now, in the blink of an eye...

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.720
We've both lost our fathers.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.000
Tang Xin.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.110
Your father and mine
were lifelong best friends.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.830
Even though our generation
hasn't had much contact,

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.070
now that we're both at Moma Group,

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.480
we should stand together.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.270
There are many things

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.530
you don't understand.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.560
During hand raising in the meeting
this morning...

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.510
Fang Lu.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.590
Have you found You Yuxiang?

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:00.350
Not yet.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.480
We'll keep looking.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.080
I'll go protect Mo Yuanzhi.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.640
Next,

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.700
I'd like to introduce a friend to you.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.270
She's also an outstanding alumna

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.440
of our Ivy Bay University,

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.880
and my partner.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.480
Please give a warm welcome to

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.750
the Assistant to the Chief Scientist
of Moma Biotechnology,

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:24.680
Dr. An Lan.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.590
Hello everyone, I'm An Lan.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.640
I'm honored to be here to share with you

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.970
the developments in genetic technology.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.000
Are you upset

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.130
because I said you didn't understand?

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.810
I do understand.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.960
Moma is like a scale.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.920
Once it loses balance,

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.030
everything will fall into chaos.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.480
We all need to pick a side.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.070
Those stuck in between

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.480
never get their share.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.640
I'll never be able to reach

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.280
the top of the core technology pyramid,

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.200
right?

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.200
Seems someone has already talked to you.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.830
Tell me.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.680
Which side do you want me to take?

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:34.890
Mo Yuanzhi's side.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:38.920
I'm serious.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.640
You need to side with the tech faction.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.770
The technology pyramid you just mentioned,

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.140
you don't need to be at the top.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.720
You just need

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.100
an access card to the base of the pyramid.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.070
Thank you, everyone.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.960
I'm An Lan.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.960
Thank you, Dr. An Lan,
for your excellent speech.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.180
Please welcome Dr. Mo Yuanzhi.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.720
Now we'll open the floor for questions.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.030
If you have any questions
for your senior brother,

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.550
feel free to speak up.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.420
That young man over there.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:38.400
Hello, Dr. Mo.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.070
As far as I know,

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.880
RAN technology has existed
for less than 10 years.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.750
By medical industry standards,

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.240
it hasn't been tested
for a sufficient period of time.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.270
How can we be sure of its safety?

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.970
He asked a different question
than in the last loop.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.310
As RAN technology develops,

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:57.550
will there be more and more diseases

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.110
that can be cured through it?

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.180
In that case,

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:03.270
will traditional pharmaceutical factories
go bust?

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.350
That's a profound question.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.030
Thank you.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:07.510
However,

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:08.510
efficacy and side effects

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.200
have always been contradictory.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.720
This has also been a topic

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.790
of endless research

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:14.920
and debate in the medical field
for centuries.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.480
Whether RAN technology has safety risks

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.070
cannot be explained in just a few words.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.070
But I can assure you that

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:22.240
my team and I

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:22.960
have used

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.000
the world's most advanced
technical methods

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.720
and the most rigorous testing standards

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.550
to verify the safety of RAN technology.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:29.310
So far,

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.110
there have been no safety issues.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:32.150
Although Moma Biotechnology

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.030
hasn't detected any safety risks,

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.070
over the past two years,

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.550
many experts have

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.550
pointed out RAN's technical flaws.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.750
But their statements
have all been suppressed.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:44.480
Isn't that a sign
that Moma has something to hide?

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.000
Young man,

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.200
you're giving us too much credit.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.750
First of all, Moma has never
suppressed

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.350
any expert or statement.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.790
We don't have that capability.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.350
Secondly,

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:56.550
those so-called "statements" you mentioned

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:57.640
seem to be just

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.070
your own imagination.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.070
Do you have any facts to support that?

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.510
Or perhaps

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.110
you're asking questions this way

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.270
just to show off?

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.200
Are you suggesting

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.610
that as long as no one dies, it's safe?

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.000
Your question

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.110
is just like asking which came first,

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:13.160
the chicken or the egg.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.440
Then can you talk about

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.920
the academic disagreements

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.070
between you and your mentor back then?

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.430
You're being a bit unreasonable,
young man.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.230
But it's fine.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:35.280
You have the right to speak freely.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.270
But I believe

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.200
if you want to prove that RAN technology

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.110
is unsafe,

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.480
please provide data
to support your argument.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.210
RAN has already gotten people killed,
hasn't it?

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.000
Otherwise, why would
your company's executives,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Han Song and Tang Shaorong,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.110
have been killed?

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.590
Yet you're still here joking
as if nothing happened.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:53.750
What are you hiding?

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.070
Everyone, please be quiet.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.830
Students.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.690
Be quiet.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:03.680
Be quiet!

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.790
Mo Yuanzhi.

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.310
Do you remember what this place is?

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:40.270
You know where I am,

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:41.110
Mo Yuanzhi.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:51.410
What is this place?

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.110
Speak!

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.550
I'm not entirely sure,

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:58.000
but it might be

00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.940
an underground laboratory.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.840
Is that Mr. You?

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.020
Mr. You, what do you want to do?

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.130
Are you going to hurt this girl?

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:26.380
If you have something to ask me,

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:27.010
let her go,

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:28.760
and we can talk properly. Okay?

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.170
Talk properly?

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.570
Haven't you said enough already?

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.030
Have you had any remorse?

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.960
Say it out loud.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.510
Where am I!

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.900
You're in an underground laboratory.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.150
No.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.420
This is where you destroyed evidence

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.870
and killed your mentor Jiang Yuwen.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.570
Do you want to save this girl?

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:36.230
Then confess

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.710
all your crimes in detail!

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.550
Mr. You, what on earth
are you talking about?

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.410
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.170
Have you been having issues again...

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.360
Everyone's been saying

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.760
that there might be something wrong
with your brain,

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.280
but I've always had great respect for you.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.070
Mr. You.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.690
Many people here today are your students.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:01.440
They admire and respect you,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.480
including me.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.550
Please don't become a murderer
right in front of us,

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:05.320
Mr. You, okay?

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.440
You're the murderer!

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.960
Still acting, huh?

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.400
Don't hurt that girl!

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.550
Fine!

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.320
I'm a murderer, okay?

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.360
I'll be whatever you say I am.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.400
Let her go.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.190
I'll come to you,

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.150
and we'll go to the police station
together.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.880
Is that okay?

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.330
Don't move!

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.480
Freeze!

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.880
You Yuxiang!

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:55.850
Put the knife down!

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.800
You cops don't care
whether the hostage lives or dies, do you?

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.540
Put your guns down.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.070
Put them down!

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:33.840
Mr. You.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.590
Mr. You.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.460
I don't have any weapons on me,

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.210
and they won't hurt you either.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.060
Let's talk.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.850
I think I've seen you before,

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.750
but I don't seem to know you.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.800
Whatever you need,

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.230
or whatever conditions you have,

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.230
you can tell me.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.700
Go investigate

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:07.970
Jiang Yuwen's disappearance case
from 8 years ago.

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:09.760
That wasn't a disappearance case.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.030
It was a murder!

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.550
And the murderer is...

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:16.280
Mo Yuanzhi!

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.440
Mr. You,

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.170
I really don't understand
why you're doing this.

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.000
I just can't figure out

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:57.630
what benefit you'll get

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.280
from destroying me.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.070
But if you insist on doing this,

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:01.800
Mr. You,

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.550
that's fine.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:03.880
I'll fully cooperate with you.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.320
Let that girl go,

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.280
and I'll come to you.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.510
The police are right over there.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:09.670
We can let them investigate
and find out the truth.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.880
Is that okay, Mr. You?

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.760
You're such a hypocrite.

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:21.550
I promise you

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.430
I will definitely
get to the bottom of this.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.570
But I need you to cooperate with me

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.940
and put the knife down.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.400
I had a dream last night.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.600
In that dream, someone asked me,

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.670
a life for a life,

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:40.350
is it worth it?

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:43.760
When I woke up this morning,

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.030
I realized

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:49.150
it's not worth it.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.480
Killing Mo Yuanzhi

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:53.800
is not my goal.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:56.840
My goal is

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:00.930
to let the whole world know about
Mo Yuanzhi's crimes!

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.030
If Mo Yuanzhi is guilty,

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.920
I'll definitely bring him to justice.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.440
But Mr. You,
I need you to cooperate with me

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.370
so we can figure this out together.

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:11.030
This girl is innocent.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.840
I believe you don't want to
hurt your own student, either,

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.400
do you?

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.400
Mr. You.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.980
Put down the knife.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.420
Put it down.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.230
I can't give you much.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.200
You'll have to
find the evidence yourself.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:42.910
You're different from
other police officers I've met.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:44.570
You're different.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.280
I beg you.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.210
I beg you!

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:52.960
Freeze!
