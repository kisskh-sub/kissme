[Episode 4]

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.880
Tang Rou, I'll go save the others first.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.560
I probably won't need the entire jar
of Nether Dew.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.229
Your sister wants Nether Dew as a gift,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.900
but she doesn't necessarily
need the whole jar, right?

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.170
That's right, Fang.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.800
You'd better not play tricks on me.

[Wonder Liquor Inn]

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.550
Big Brother.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.200
Chaoran, Yuhan.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.050
Let's go upstairs to
detoxify Mr. Feng first.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.430
Fang.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.120
Just help Big Brother

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.970
remove the Silver Butterfly Dart, okay?

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.910
Let's go.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.000
Let's go.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.200
Let's begin.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.810
Before removing the dart, let's talk.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.370
I have nothing to talk about with you.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.400
Fine. Let's not talk then.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.290
I'm warning youâ€”

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.400
Rou is innocent and trusting.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.910
He keeps calling you Big Brother now.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.470
I'm afraid he's been thoroughly
deceived by you.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.030
I don't care what happened
between you two before,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.560
but stay away from Rou from now on.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.520
Alright.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.040
Smart choice.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.560
I do agree,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.150
but whether Rou wants to follow me or not

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.310
isn't up to me.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.220
You have to ask him.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.970
Don't worry about that.
Just keep your promise.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.270
Your set of tools looks well-prepared.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.430
You must be rather experienced

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.159
in removing darts, aren't you?

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.310
If the dart were shot by me,
you'd be dead by now.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.640
There wouldn't be any chance to remove it.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.600
Take a look.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.120
What do you think of this one
that's three inches long?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.680
What do you mean what I think?

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.540
Why ask me that?

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.800
Scared?

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.830
Me, scared? Let's get on with it.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.760
Wait, that's not right.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.560
There's still more in there.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.490
A month from now,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.670
if you have no more entanglements
with Rou,

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.690
I'll remove the other dart.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.730
You lowlife.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.500
Blame the way of the world.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.530
Big Brother!

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.560
Big Brother.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.630
It went great.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.690

Fang.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.170
Give me the rest of the Nether Dew.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.390
Well, Fang,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.870
the wine is all gone.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.840
Are you messing with me?

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.240
Blame the way of the world, I guess?

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.570
Why the glare? You were the one
who was unkind from the start.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.360
Big Brother! You...

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.470
What exactly do you want?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.920
My Silver Butterfly Dart
has its body and wings connected.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.560
It's up to you whether you want to
suffer the consequences.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.490
You're skilled at brewing, right?

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.070
Reproduce a jar of Nether Dew for me.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.030
I'll be checking it tonight.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.000
If it's not convincing enough,

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.970
you can find out what happens.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.700
Are you okay, Big Brother?

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.480
Does it hurt?

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.690
Of course it hurts.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.360
Tang Rou,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.340
can you remove the remaining dart

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.120
for me?

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.640
It really hurts so much.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.760
I can't, Big Brother.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.680
In our Tang Sect,
everyone's hidden weapons

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.280

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.000
Besides,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.800
Fang is so skilled.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.500
If I interfere rashly,

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.080
your arm will be permanently damaged.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.380
What should we do then?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.380
What choice do we have?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.520
Time to start blending the wine.

It's my fault for
failing to assist you in time, Master.

Otherwise, I would never forgive myself.

anything unusual about her?

please kill me now.

Please forgive me, Deputy Chief Liu.

But the one with the token's not here.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.600
On their escort route,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.860
they found Old Madam Wu

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.270
and did want to steal
the Hero Command Token from her.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.030
However, Zhang Linyi,

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.910
the Yin-Yang Divine Swordsman
accompanying Old Madam Wu got suspicious.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.840
Once they entered Jinzhong,
they lost track of them.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.390
But it's said that Old Madam Wu

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.880
boarded the carriage of Huanhua Sect.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.600
Huanhua Sect?

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.650
We also found the Marching Pills,

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.670
supposedly meant for
the Northern Wastelanders.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.440
Purple Phoenix.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.840
Who bribed you

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.510
to take my life?

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:45.930
How did you know...

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.890
How did you know
I was going to poison you?

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.930
You came all this way to kill me

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.380
and even brought
my favorite Qishan Cuimei tea.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.910
You think only the tea was poisoned?

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.170
Fifth Master Liu, you're immune
to all poisons,

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.000
but whenever you encounter Marching Pills,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.660
you'll definitely take them.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.600
So in this Marching Pill,

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.960
I infused the non-toxic poison,

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.120
the Noxious Beetles.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:35.120
You think I'm the only one
in Power Gang

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.320
who wants you dead?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.730
Who's there?

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:22.870
Feng Lang?

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.200
He called me "lucky bag."

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:29.960
Get up.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.200
I never thought that
in the midst of fleeing the chase,

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.860
I casually killed someone
and took their place,

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.510
yet Xiao Qiushui would trust me
so completely.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.470
Song Mingzhu.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.470
Do you know what kind of identity

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.550
is referred to as "lucky bag"
in the martial world?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.100
I've never heard of it.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.160
Could it be some official title?

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.290
Xiao Qiushui kept calling me that.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.150
I wonder what he meant.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.480
Anyway,

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.000
with this identity,

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.750
I can enter the Xiao family
before Sword King.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.000
All his schemes

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.480
to have Purple Phoenix come kill me
were in vain.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.600
Master, you mean

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.800
Purple Phoenix attacked you
on Sword King's orders?

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.200
Whoever gets the Hero Command Token
for Chief

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.150
will earn great merit,

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.850
and Sword King and I
have never gotten along.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:34.840
If he gets it,

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.320
he'll naturally use it against me.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.640
Yet, as it turns out,

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.520
he has unwittingly delivered me
a masterstroke.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.600
You're blessed with great fortune, Master,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.720
having met that guy from the Xiao family.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.790
I heard they formed

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.270
something called
Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.000
Always talking about chivalry.
How ridiculous.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.810
In this martial world,

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.750
the word "righteousness"
has long since died.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.160
They're just a bunch of hypocrites,

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.560
chasing profit
yet too ashamed to admit it.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.400
Sooner or later, they'll kneel before
our Power Gang.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.589
The Huanhua Sect is easy to defend
but hard to attack.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:15.480
Using this identity
to go with Xiao Qiushui

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.200
will truly make things much easier.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:19.200
The Hero's Token

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.460
will soon be in your possession, Master.

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:24.000
Then you can bring the Xiao family
under your control.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.480
Let's see how that Sword King
can fight against you then.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.540
The Xiao family doesn't deserve to be
under my command.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.510
I still have a score to settle with them.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:39.760
By the way,

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.030
don't let Sword King know of
my whereabouts.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.760
This Xiao Qiushui
does resemble Chief somewhat.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.880
In our gang, only the Eight Kings

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.470
have seen the true faces of me and Chief.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.070
Even if the Eight Kings see him,

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.930
they won't mistake him for Chief.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.980
No need to report this.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.510
Just wait for my instructions.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.030
Got it.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:02.350
I'll wait near Huanhua Sect
for your message, Master.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.930
Big Brother.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.310
What do you think of this?

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.840
I think this is pretty good.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.250
Thank you all for saving me.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.440
Mr. Feng, seeing you like this,

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.360
are you feeling better?

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.080
I'm much better now.
I can't thank you enough.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.170
Don't mention it, Mr. Feng.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.170
Our Big Brother

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.160
was actually looking for someone
named Feng Lang.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
We never expected to really find you.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.360
I'm just a nobody not worth mentioning.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.400
I spoke ill before,

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.310
Mr. Xiao, yet you didn't take offense

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:49.590
and even saved me multiple times.
I'm truly grateful for that.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.390
Should you ever require my service
in the future, I shall not refuse.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.260
That's not important.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.300
What matters is...

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.280
Do you consider me a friend?

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.270
Do you now consider me your best friend?

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.510
Mr. Xiao, you're my close friend.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.160
Alright.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.270
That's good then.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.270
Actually, it's quite a coincidence.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.830
After much effort, the Iron-Clad Constable
entrusted someone to find my master,

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.680
asking me to deliver a letter to him
at Huanhua Sect.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.340
It just so happens
I can travel with you, Mr. Xiao

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.310
Y-You've just recovered from poisoning.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.480
There must still be some residual toxins
in your body.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.340
How about this?

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.350
Come back with me to Huanhua Sect,

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.110
and I'll find someone to help clear
the remaining poison from your body.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.110
What do you think?

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.270
Okay.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.130
Where's my wine?

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.550
If there's no wine, nobody leaves.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.440
Fang.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.160
Wait here.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.400
Can this wine fool her, Big Brother?

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.550
Feng, please don't be angry.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.830
You're already injured,

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.640
and now you've caught a cold
from the water.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.640
It'll get worse if we don't treat it.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.560
Here's the medicine. Come on, take it.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.110
Are you Tang Fang from the Tang Sect?

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.970
And who are you?

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.750
I am Feng Lang, the owner of
the Rain Sword.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.410
So you're that sickly fellow
who used up all the Nether Dew.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.920
Let me tell you, you're part of this too.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.400
Fang.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.600
Your wine.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.030
Fang!

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.350
You're fooling me. It's all fake!

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.200
Tang Fang, I've put up with you
long enough.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.680
If it weren't for Tang Rou's sake...

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.820
Let me tell you.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.950
If it weren't for you all,

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.370
I would have already
knocked the Omniscience Door open.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.890
Keep brewing. If you can't get it done,
don't sleep.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:05.510
Miss.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.870
You're heading to the Omniscience Door

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:08.920
to consult Jade Cicada,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.030
hoping to gain some insight
into the martial world, right?

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.760
Perhaps I can be of assistance.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:15.790
You?

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.990
I'm somewhat acquainted with Jade Cicada.

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.960
Give him this jade pendant,

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.160
and he'll speak once.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.620
Just this one jade pendant

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.290
to make Jade Cicada speak?

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.550
You must be a fraud too, aren't you?

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.010
I'm about to go to Huanhua Sect
with Mr. Xiao.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.270
If this doesn't work,

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.400
you can come find me.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.000
That's better than wasting time here.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.030
Fine.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.210
Huanhua Sect is not far from
our Tang Sect.

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.240
You won't get away.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:05.550
Hold on.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:24.280
My friend helped you. You should
return the favor, don't you think?

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.080
Fang, your Silver Butterfly Dart
is going deeper and deeper.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.830
If you don't remove it now,

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.760
Big Brother will truly be injured.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:56.110
Tang Rou, friends like these

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:57.680
are best avoided.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.210
I'll take you home as soon as
I finish my business.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.440
Fang...

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:05.790
Big Brother, are you okay?

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.330
Seriously, still touching me?

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:08.790
Sorry, I won't touch you again.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.310
Bear with it. It'll stop hurting soon.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.440
Don't worry. It's no big deal.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.920
This Jade Cicada

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.580
can gather information
from the martial world.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.880
That does sound impressive.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.680
Mr. Feng, how did you come to know him?

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.000
By chance, just like you and me.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.030
We were strangers just days ago,

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.890
and now we're friends, aren't we?

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:39.510
I see.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.590
Well, I have a problem now.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:45.720
My brother Yiren

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.780
will soon become the young sect leader
of Huanhua Sect.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.530
Mr. Feng,

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.160
how should I compete with him
for this position?

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.680
You want to be the leader of Huanhua Sect?

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.480
That's right.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.960
You're far behind your brother.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.160
However, there's a rule in Jinzhong

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.350
that if a young hero

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:06.240
can get a recommendation from
a renowned master in the martial world,

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.170
they can challenge the successor.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.010
A renowned master in the martial world...

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.240
Got it.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.030
[Omniscience Door]

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.730
This is Tang Fang of the Tang Sect,
requesting to see Master Yu.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.720
I have something of your old friend.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.480
Please grant me a single word, Sir.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.750
Indeed, that's Master's style.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.040
Since you're a friend of Master's,

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.400
go ahead and ask.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.310
Where exactly is the Voidheart Codex?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.160
In the Xiao Residence of Huanhua Sect.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.960
The Xiao Residence.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.030
So the rumors are true.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.000
Old Madam Wu is indeed hiding
in the Xiao Residence.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.590
Greetings, Old Madam Wu.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.470
Please, have a seat.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.400
Old Madam Wu, are you feeling better?

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.330
[Old Madam Wu]

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:22.660
I'm deeply grateful that you two

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.880
have allowed me to take refuge here.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.310
Just some old ailments,
nothing worth mentioning.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.370
Old Madam Wu.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.160
I've received a secret letter
from General Wu Jie.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.280
In seven days,

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.690
he'll send someone to Tongfu Inn
in Lingliang Town.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:37.800
[Zhang Linyi, Yin-Yang Divine Swordsman]

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:40.590
At that time,

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.400
my wife and I

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.830
will secretly escort you to town

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.800
to meet with the General.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.750
Thank you both for your trouble.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.310
Ever since Crazy Yan

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.200
entrusted me with the Hero Command Token,

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.480
the martial world has seen much bloodshed.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.880
Even with Mr. Zhang protecting me,

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.730
I've faced danger many times.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.470
Thanks to your Xiao family's chivalry,

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.510
letting me hide in the Huanhua Sect.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:15.350
Otherwise, I'm afraid the Hero's Token
would have fallen into the wrong hands.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.790
Old Madam Wu,
please don't say such things.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:18.830
This is simply

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.110
our duty as martial artists.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.830
Secrets cannot be kept
in the martial world.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.270
I'm not sure whether
me hiding in the Xiao family

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:29.510
can be kept secret
for the remaining seven days.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.110
Old Madam Wu, let the martial world
handle its own troubles.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.550
You needn't worry.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.960
We'll take care of

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.400
everything.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.160
[Huanhua Sect]

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.270
I grounded you,

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.580
yet you went out causing trouble.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:50.840
Seems I was too lenient.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.160
You're forcing me to punish you
with our family law,

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:54.820
aren't you?

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.720
Come on, bend over!

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.480
Father.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.070
I-I didn't go out
to cause trouble this time.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.200
I had important business to deal with.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:02.880
You?

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.700
What important business?

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.810
Being a hero, of course.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.830
You? Being a hero?

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.830
Making up stories, huh?

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.440
What a nice story!
Keep making things up, huh?

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.680
Father, seriously, please don't hit me!

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.160
Look, good deeds are usually done
anonymously,

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.440
and those who seek recognition
rarely do good, right?

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.270
Really? You've really made something
of yourself, haven't you?

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.960
Fine. I'll grant your wish.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.420
Father!

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.300
Stop hitting him!

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.510
Stop hitting him!

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.880
That's enough! What are you doing?

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.400
What am I doing? I'm disciplining him.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.060
He just got back
and you're already hitting him.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.720
Your sister gathered some rehmannia
from the back mountain.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.000
I've already told the kitchen staff

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.110
to make some chicken soup

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.350
for your friends.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.070
Why are you still standing there?

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.330
Go help in the kitchen.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.070
Come on.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.640
Where is he going?

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.700
I'm disciplining him.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.790
You keep spoiling him like this,

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.830
making him more and more reckless!

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.200
You don't understand the situation at all.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.200
Qiushui really wasn't messing around
this time.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.840
I've already asked Yuhan and the others.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.830
They did go to watch dragon boat races
in Zihui.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:04.750
But think about it.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.590
Honoring Qu Yuan
on the Dragon Boat Festival

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.270
is just a folk custom.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.240
Don't you remember
that you'd go every year

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.750
when you were young?

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.680
One year, you even fell into the river,

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.000
and I was the one who pulled you out.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.440
Don't bring up me falling into the river
when I was young.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.240
Every time you mention this,
it's about me falling into the river.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.400
Do I have any dignity left?

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.400
Well, did you fall into the river or not?

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.030
Do you know that

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.510
he even lost his sword?

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.400
A swordsman who lost his sword.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.400
What kind of image is that?

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.000
How can I not discipline him?

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.350
I...

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.880
Who allowed you to stand up?

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.240
-Kneel!
-I told him to stand up.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.240
You... Kneel!

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.570
Get out of my way.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.040
You...

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.110
Hit me instead!

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.770
How could you let him stand up?

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.000
-Move.
-Then hit me instead.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.930
Get out of my way!

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:42.640
Kneel!

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.000
Hit me instead!

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.420
Hey, you...

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.920
Mother.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.500
Don't think I wouldn't dare!

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.110
Mr. Xiao.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.810
Sorry we didn't welcome you properly.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.720
The vigor with which you lecture your son,

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.320
it's been ages
since we've seen such a display.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.680
Youthful impulsiveness
isn't a major fault.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.880
Greetings, Mr. Xiao.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.060
Alright, Mr. Xiao.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.160
Let's go have some drinks.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.280
That's what really matters.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.200
Senior, please calm down.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.920
The ceremony to appoint
the young sect leader of Huanhua Sect

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.920
Is ready outside.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.090
We have many things to attend to soon.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.480
Qiushui, come on.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.790
Come thank all your uncles.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.480
We'll leave then.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.330
What are you standing there for? Let's go.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.680
Mother, I want to be
the young sect leader.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.310
[Zhu Xiawu, Iron-Clad Constable,
Liushan Sect]

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.010
[Kang Jiesheng, son of Kang Chuyu]
[Kang Chuyu, Sun-Gazing Divine Swordsman]

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.790
Qiushui, what are you talking about?

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.790
You want to compete with your brother?

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.590
Don't be ridiculous. Leave now.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.480
Qiushui.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.640
Did you hear me?

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.820
You're making me angry again.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:14.770
I, Xiao Qiushui, wish to compete for
the position of Huanhua's young leader.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.270
It so happens that
you're all here, uncles.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.000
Could you please recommend me?

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.310
Qiushui.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.960
I'm not joking.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.550
I sincerely ask you seniors
to give me a chance.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.550
You're indeed full of vigor, young man.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.590
But do you know

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.880
the position of young sect leader
has long been decided?

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.960
Actually, I think

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.170
we can take our time
to consider this matter further.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.640
Qiushui, my wise nephew,

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.070
there's no need for haste.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.960
No, Uncle.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:54.640
I really can't wait.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.240
Dear uncles,

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.720
if only one of you would recommend me

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.400
and give me a letter of recommendation.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.720
Please consider me.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.140
Give me a chance, will you?

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.590
Qiushui, it's not that we're unwilling,

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.270
but Yiren truly deserves the position.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.920
In five years, I believe
you'll be ready to challenge.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.270
Five years?

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.850
You must be kidding.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.510
Qiushui, stop messing around.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.380
Leave now.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.480
We still have important matters
to discuss.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.920
Reflect on the mistakes you made today.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.790
-Let's go, Qiushui.
-Father.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.590
-Qiushui.
-Leave now!

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:31.310
-Let's go.
-Mother.

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:32.310
Come on, get up.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.030
Let's go.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.110
We're leaving.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.790
We'll talk about it later.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:38.440
Uncle.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.160
Let's go.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:44.400
My unruly son has made a fool of himself.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.240
Please, sit down.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.790
Come on, please.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.550
Please.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:51.960
What's wrong?

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.580
Is your shoulder injured?

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.160
Mother, I'm fine.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.440
Let me see.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.400
Mother, it's really nothing.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.920
Mother, I won't make you angry anymore.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.800
I won't get into fights recklessly either.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:13.480
Do you think I'm angry because you fought?

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.070
I'm angry because you were being reckless.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.760
In the martial world, fighting is common.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.250
But being reckless can cost you your life.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:24.230
I want my son

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.440
to learn to say it hurts when he's injured

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.190
and learn to run when he can't win.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:30.120
Don't try to be a hero, understand?

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.199
I'll remember that.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.440
Don't worry.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.489
I'm quick when it comes to
running for my life.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.150
But I never thought

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.630
our Qiushui would have such ideas.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.150
Although it's quite unrealistic,

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.840
I really like it.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.760
I forgot.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.610
Are you okay?

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:53.360
I'm okay.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.960
You must be hungry.
I'll make you some noodles.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:57.960
Wait here.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.670
Mother.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:12.320
I will definitely change
our Xiao family's fate.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.630
When you were sick as a child,

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:26.960
you loved this the most.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:27.760
Eat up.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.330
Mingming.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.110
Here.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.130
The noodles are ready.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.560
What's wrong?

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.360
What's the matter, Qiushui?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.730
Are my noodles that delicious?

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.740
It's just I haven't tasted this flavor
for too long.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.710
Silly boy.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.520
Didn't I make this for you
just last month?

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.880
If you like it,

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.510
I'll make it

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:49.630
for you every day.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.380
Thank you, Mother.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.320
I've already instructed the kitchen staff.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.190
Tonight, let's treat your friends

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.120
to a grand feast.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.670
Alright.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.590
You aim to be the young sect leader.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:09.570
Come on, eat up.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:11.880
I will.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.090
This is indeed the Marching Pill.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.200
After taking the Marching Pill,

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:36.440
one feels no hunger or thirst,
but becomes violent and frenzied.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.140
More than a decade ago,

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:41.110
Baicao Valley created this pill.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.710
They attempted to give it to
the Northern Wastelanders

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.170
to bring calamity to Daxi.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.880
We righteous sects joined forces

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.320
to eliminate them

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.840
and destroyed all Marching Pills.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.710
I never expected that
after all these years,

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.640
someone would create this thing again.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.280
It must be the remnants of Baicao Valley.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.800
If the Northern Wasteland obtains
this evil thing again,

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.860
it will surely cause turmoil in Daxi.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.920
I think

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.190
we should send some people

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.020
to investigate in Guangling.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.320
I recall the Xiao family
has another residence in Guangling.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.650
Please make plans immediately, Mr. Xiao.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.730
I'll have things arranged tomorrow.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.440
Big Brother, you've lost weight recently.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.110
Aunt, please eat more.

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:24.190
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:25.800
-Finally, this day has come.
-Here.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.360
Thank you.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.440
Then eat more.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.560
You know what?

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.320
Especially this
sweet bamboo shoots with pork.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.320
It's my favorite.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:34.030
I think you're wrong about that.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:35.270
Every dish Aunt makes

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.110
is something I've been longing for.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:39.110
You're always such a sweet-talker.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.590
Eat more.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.110
Our Qiushui

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:43.800
was raised strictly by his father.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.590
I was worried

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.760
that he'd become timid and fearful.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.960
Thankfully, he has good friends like you,

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.760
running wild together with him.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.760
Here, I'd like to toast to you all.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.190
-Cheers, Aunt.
-Cheers, Aunt.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.710
Is "running wild" a compliment
or criticism?

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:58.030
That's just how our family talks.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.960
Come on, cheers.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.440
-Cheers.
-Let's get hammered today.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.100
Youth is meant for being wild.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.480
Thanks.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.410
Come on, Aunt, try some too.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.630
I'll help myself.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.070
Feng Lang, Mr. Feng.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.590
I just heard from Iron-Clad Constable

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:24.920
that you've been a great help
to him this time.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.830
Meeting you today,

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.590
you're truly
a fine and accomplished gentleman.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:29.390
Come on, let me toast you as well.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.940
Mrs. Xiao, you flatter me.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.720
Rain Sword, your lightness skill
is exceptional.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.690
You raced against a fine horse
for a day and night without losing.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:43.150
That's how you became famous.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.550
Mrs. Xiao, you're mistaken.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:45.710
Jiangnan is rich in waters.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:48.040
The thing I raced against
was a small boat.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.800
Qiushui.

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:55.920
Look at me.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.330
I'm getting old and my memory is failing.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.670
So, Mr. Feng, what poison
were you struck with?

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.920
Mother, it was the Noxious Beetles.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:11.590
The Noxious Beetles are truly rare.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:12.190
I wonder

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.190
why the Power Gang

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:15.590
would poison you like this, Mr. Feng?

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.150
I told Xiao about this before.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.220
I saw something I shouldn't have.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:32.520
Have you heard about the massacre
at Changle Escort Agency?

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:41.960
It happened a few days ago.
Everyone in Jinzhong is talking about it.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.020
I was there on the day of the massacre.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.190
I was planning to hire
Changle Escort Agency for a job.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.230
But unexpectedly, I ran into Power Gang
committing the crime.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.800
Although I managed to escape,

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.000
I was still poisoned.

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:57.530
I heard Liu Suifeng from the Power Gang
was also there that day.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.920
To survive an encounter with that villain

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:01.800
is truly remarkable, Mr. Feng.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.400
Feng Lang.

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:12.840
What were you hiring
the Changle Escort Agency to transport?

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.440
The letter my master asked me to deliver
to Iron-Clad Constable.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.780
I did escape by sheer luck,

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:21.630
but I think I heard

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.710
that the Power Gang's massacre

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:25.440
was to find someone important.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.240
I wonder if any of you

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.450
have heard any rumors on the road.

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.280
I haven't heard anything about that.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.920
The Changle Escort Agency is in Jinzhong.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.650
Could that important person also
be in Jinzhong?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Aunt, your Huanhua Sect
has extensive connections in Jinzhong.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.840
Have you heard of

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.570
any important figures coming?

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.840
I haven't.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.190
These trivial matters of the martial world
are such a mood killer.

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:58.670
Let's not talk about it today.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:01.150
Today, let's just drink to
our heart's content!

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:02.230
Right, drink to our heart's content.

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.920
Drink to our heart's content.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:03.960
Come on, let's drink to
our heart's content.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.480
Cheers!

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.940
Come, let's drink up. Cheers!

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:09.030
-Bottoms up.
-Cheers, Big Brother.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.920
Thank you for your hospitality, Aunt!

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.840
Thanks for having us.
