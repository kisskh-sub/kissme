00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:10.208
Your Highness

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.958
There may be wolves ahead.

00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:13.583
Let me send someone to scout ahead.

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:14.666
Just in case.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.791
A few of you come with me.

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:44.666
The rest stay and protect the Princess.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.708
Yes.

00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:38.875
The princess disappeared during the marriage alliance.

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:42.125
Li Jingnian, Deputy Chief of the Special Case Bureau,

00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:44.791
set out to find the princess.

00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.041
Within a hundred li around here,

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:47.458
the village ahead is the only one.

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:49.458
They say there was a plague here years ago.

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:51.625
It's probably abandoned now.

00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:53.750
The last place the princess was seen

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.583
should be nearby. Let's go.

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:56.375
Mm.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.083
Hey.

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:22.541
Child.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.208
Let me ask you something.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:28.791
Let's take a look.

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:30.041
Let's go.

00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.458
Hey, wait!

00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:01.125
We live in Jintai Chidingluo.

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:03.041
We traveled far to worship Buddha.

00:04:03.416 --> 00:04:05.666
Elder, could you help us?

00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:20.750
Old man.

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:22.875
We're here to find someone.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.125
Have you seen this person?

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.333
You'd better leave now.

00:04:32.458 --> 00:04:33.958
There's no place for you here.

00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:50.125
Hey, what treasure will you give me?

00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:54.583
Sister has a treasure.

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:04.083
It smells so nice.

00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:41.875
Help, quickly!

00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:04.000
Grandpa! Grandpa!

00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:05.166
What happened to Grandpa?

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:07.083
Grandpa is missing.

00:07:09.416 --> 00:07:10.625
I think something's wrong.

00:07:13.458 --> 00:07:14.375
Stay at home.

00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:15.750
We'll go look for your grandpa.

00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:16.875
Isn't that the sickly villager we saw at the village entrance earlier?

00:08:16.916 --> 00:08:18.541
He was a villager during the day.

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:20.625
Now it's hard to say what he is.

00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:23.500
Be careful.
