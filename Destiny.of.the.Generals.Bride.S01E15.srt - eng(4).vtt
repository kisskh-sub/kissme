00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.020
=Episode 15=

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.320
My quarter is always simple,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.559
no gold or jade about.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.280
I fear Your Highness
won't be used to it.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:27.719
It's fine.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.239
I've even stayed

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:30.719
on the bitter-cold steppe.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.880
What can't I make do with?

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:36.880
You have to go to the trouble,
Miss Qing Yan.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.240
It's all red.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.479
There have been rumors

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.719
about my preferences.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:55.520
True or false,

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.840
even I can't tell anymore.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.719
Miss Qing Yan meant well.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.640
That's why she spent a fortune
to plant these geraniums.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.280
But Grand Madam Xiao,

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:10.840
you slapped her
without knowing the truth.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.040
What do you take the law for?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.079
I...

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.040
Madam, I have my own hands.

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:18.359
If someone needs hitting,

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:19.840
I can do it myself.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.719
I wouldn't need you to do it for me.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.760
Yes, yes. I was wrong.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.120
I won't do that again.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.640
I've wronged my daughter-in-law.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.359
Debts should be repaid.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.840
A life for a life.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.760
And you think your promise is enough?

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.439
I didn't realize

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.439
you'd married such a sensible lady.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.840
Since your wife's come up
with such a thoughtful idea,

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.239
why not

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.639
show me your room?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.400
As you wish.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.400
Miss Qing Yan.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.360
My brother's courtyard is small.

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:21.879
It can house Princess,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.400
but not Her Highness.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.199
How about this?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.960
Let me take Her Highness

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.120
to the Yingfeng Pavilion.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:28.280
No need.

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.159
I've already found

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.840
an even better place for Her Highness.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.840
Qing Yan.

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.120
You don't mean to put Her Highness

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.560
in this shabby little cottage, do you?

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.639
Exactly.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.159
Her Highness is of exalted rank.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.560
How dare you slight her so?

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.360
Your Highness,

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.479
I prepared this lodging
especially for you.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.960
Please go in and take a look.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.719
If you truly don't like it,

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.960
you're free to behead me.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.560
Come, let's head in and check it out.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.960
Mother,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.560
is this still our woodshed?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.840
Why does it look different?

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.039
Let's go in and have a look first.

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:29.520
Your Highness,

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:30.680
look at the wall.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:41.520
I heard

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.360
Your Highness loves huaben.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.960
Your favorite tale

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.892
is "Record by the West Window"
by the talented female writer

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:47.990
from the former dynasty, Liu Shuzhen.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.039
That book

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.520
lost seven volumes.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.639
No one knew

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:54.000
how the two characters ended,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.159
making it a regrettable history.

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.240
This spring heavy rains

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.159
flooded several homes in An County.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.759
Tables and chairs rotted,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.159
plaster peeled.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.360
Yet there was a blessing in disguise.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.479
Beneath the wall

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.560
was a hidden treasure.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.680
It seems to be the missing volumes
of "Record by the West Window".

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.080
You mean

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.719
this is where Liu Shuzhen once lived?

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.720
I feared being duped,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.519
so I had the handwriting compared.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.279
It does look similar.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.480
But I'm poorly read,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.519
so I don't know for sure.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.360
So I had them

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:28.519
buy the entire house

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.439
and move it here.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:32.319
Please enlighten us, Your Highness.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.839
How extraordinary.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.319
An County is hundreds of li away,

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.639
yet you moved it here intact.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.360
You must've spent a fortune on it.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.360
Above all, how thoughtful you've been.

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:52.959
No wonder Zhaoping
keeps praising you.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.560
Even I can't help wanting to keep you.

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.279
Your ancestors must have blessed you.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.120
That's why you managed
to get such a good daughter-in-law.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.120
So you feel fortunate.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.319
We do feel fortunate. For sure.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.240
I'll stay here tonight.

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:11.160
Bring more lanterns.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.720
I want to see

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:13.680
what kind of story

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.959
is written on the wall.

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:18.959
Your Highness,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.079
how about

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.879
I have someone copy it down

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:23.160
and have it delivered

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.639
to the Yingfeng Pavilion for you to read?

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.120
Who is this?

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.360
This is my second son, Xiao Ye.

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.759
The original writing of Liu Shuzhen
is here,

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:33.879
and you'd send me elsewhere?

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:35.959
You really are a blockhead.

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:37.759
Why?

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.360
Can you read?

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.120
Yes, I can.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.560
If you can read, why say such nonsense?

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:50.360
Your Highness, he's ignorant,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.720
so don't stoop to his level.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.480
I specially prepared

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.959
these fine fruits and preserves.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.720
They were delivered here in no time

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.319
from your hometown of Huiyang.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.839
You can snack as you read,

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.560
doesn't that sound delightful?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.480
Good, good!

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.480
But

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.240
make sure the lanterns are brighter.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.959
It's been ages
since I read by lamplight.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.680
Where are you going?

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.199
I'm packing up

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.839
to make room for you and Princess.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.160
You're handing me over to her?

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:32.319
You're a man,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.480
not an object.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.879
What do you mean by handing over?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.480
Besides, your limbs are yours.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.480
If I handed you over,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.360
would you really just obey?

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.000
Fine, I'll pack

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:47.240
and go with you.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.959
Please don't. If Princess
follows you to the Yingfeng Pavilion

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.279
and finds the gold and silver

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.160
I gave her are fake,

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:54.920
we'll both be done for.

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:58.519
So you really want me to stay here?

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.759
Like I said, staying here

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:04.240
doesn't mean you can't run.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.879
How did I manage

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.079
to marry such a crafty wife

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.839
like you?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.480
Here.

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:27.600
I told you to curry favor with them,

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.360
and you ended up spouting nonsense!

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.079
If you had half of Qing Yan's wit,

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:33.839
I'd already be a titled lady.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:36.319
Instead, I have to clean up
after your mess all the time.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.240
I'm not good with words,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.639
and I'm not as shrewd as you.

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:40.920
You...

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:42.560
How satisfying!

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:47.600
Who'd have thought it?

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.040
She managed to resolve

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.360
the entourage crisis.

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:53.720
How formidable of her.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.879
To placate Princess,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.279
she even sold out her own husband.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.720
I really underestimated her.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:06.639
Mother, she may be acting smug.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.639
Once night falls,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.759
Xiao Yun and Princess
will blow out the lantern.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.240
She'll be the one crying.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.120
Mother,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.040
can I get up now?

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.319
My knees are sore.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.720
Mother.

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:22.120
Get up.

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.279
Mother, you're the best.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.000
You're the first

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.519
I've ever poured liquor for.

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:08.360
Why?

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.480
Must I issue a decree

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.960
to make you drink?

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.000
Your Highness,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.279
I don't hold my liquor well.

00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:31.559
What a coincidence.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.919
I don't either.

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:53.440
Hua, you say you trust the General,

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.519
but I think

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:55.759
you're scared.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.519
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have dragged me out

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:59.200
in the middle of the night to check?

00:09:59.759 --> 00:10:00.679
Don't talk nonsense.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.039
It was because of me

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:05.120
that Princess caught a chill.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.679
I'm bringing her the medicine

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:08.279
because I can't just ignore it.

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:09.600
Yes, yes.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.279
You came up with that idea
because it's him.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.840
If it were someone else,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.320
he'd do it for real,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.679
and he'd be Princess's consort.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:21.759
How's it on Her Highness's side?

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:25.120
She's engrossed in "Record by the West Window".

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.240
She hasn't noticed a thing.

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:34.039
Why did they put out the lights so early?

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.960
Could it be...

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.000
Hua,

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.879
are we still delivering the medicine?

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.399
It's getting chilly.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.480
Let's head back to Mochun Brothel.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.399
Well,

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:02.559
what secret are you two hiding

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.120
that you fear Her Majesty will find out?
