[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.920
[Episode 3]

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.280
Actually, I'm doing all this

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.140
only to become
the grandmaster of Huanhua Sect.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.479
Grandmaster?

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.530
Big Brother,
you're not joking with us, are you?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.120
Since when do you want that position?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.030
You've never talked about it.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.690
Everyone should have a dream.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.240
Well, if a member
of the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.560
is the grandmaster of a sect,

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.410
won't it sound amazing?

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.760
Won't it be impressive?

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.870
Big Brother, so you're serious?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.280
But...

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.870
Mr. Xiao is determined

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.190
to make your brother the next grandmaster.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.960
Besides, the succession ceremony

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.890
of Huanhua Sect will be held
in just a few days, right?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.910
T-That's why we need to
pool our wisdom now.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.960
Guys,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.360
use your wit
to analyze the situation for me.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.150
W-What

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.560
can I do to change my father's mind?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.030
The key to becoming the young sect leader

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.870
is to have a good reputation
in the martial world.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.850
Your brother is highly reputed
in Jinzhong now.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.470
We've done many good deeds in anonymity

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.630
over these years.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.710
Your brother is indeed much more respected

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.260
than you are in the martial world.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.960
So it's about fame.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.050
That's easy.
Let's start with a publicity campaign.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.160
Publicity campaign?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.730
What do you mean?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.280
I'm saying

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.470
that we can create a buzz.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.190
Let me explain it.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.040
For example,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.520
we can come up with
novel and awe-inspiring

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.560
nicknames and promote them around,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.990
so that I'll be known to the martial world
before making an appearance.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.360
Without further ado, guys,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.310
write down the names

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.820
of all the influential
and prominent figures

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.030
in the martial world now.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.070
I'll challenge them.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.280
Write down their names?

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.430
All of them?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.310
A-Are you sure?

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.630
Of course I am.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.590
Come up here. Hurry.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.280
D-Don't catch a cold.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.630
Come on, Qiu, Yuhan.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.840
Seriously?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.680
These many?

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.040
"Duckie Don"?

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.190
That's brilliant.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.930
He's very famous.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.800
This has been the trend
in the martial world for years.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.830
Names like "Heavenly Knight,"
"Nether Lord," "King of Fame,"

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.000
and "Super Swordsman" are commonly seen.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.720
Some even

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.800
name themselves "Sweetheart"

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.000
and "Duckie," or simply by numbers.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.800
Given that,
I'm afraid it's hard to impress others

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.750
with novel names.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.000
We can't rise to fame quickly

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.750
unless we kill many of those
from the Power Gang.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.680
But Big Brother,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.570
didn't you say
we must conserve our strength?

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.600
Now this is tricky.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.360
Actually, there's a second option.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.830
What is it?

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.360
"Behold the divine token of mystery."

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.220
“All heroes shall bow immediately.”

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.270
What nonsense is that now?

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.930
It's not nonsense,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.190
but the precious asset
of the martial world.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.310
You mean the Hero Command Token?

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.270
Yes.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.070
The Hero Command Token

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.800
was made of meteorites by the grandmasters

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.950
of Emei Sect, Wudang Sect

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.950
and Shaolin Sect.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.390
Rumor has it that Crazy Yan hid
the long lost gem of the martial world,

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.650
the Voidheart Codex, in this very token.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.260
Big Brother, if you get it,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.040
you'll shoot to fame in the martial world.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.190
The token is in the hands of
Old Madam Wu now,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.720
whose son General Wu Jie
is guarding the Immortal Pass.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.680
Everybody in the martial world

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.830
is looking for Old Madam Wu at the moment.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.240
How are we supposed to find

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.370
the Voidheart Codex

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.920
within the Hero Command Token?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.360
It's the Voidheart Codex again.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.830
I can't get the secret manual

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.830
ahead of schedule
without becoming the grandmaster.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.970
But without the secret manual,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.610
I can't become the grandmaster, can I?

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.950
What a vicious circle.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.430
Why doesn't the book just let me die?

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.720
What are you mumbling about?

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.270
This matter is not urgent. Why the rush?

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.430
Let's go have fun.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.160
Where to?

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.000
Come with me.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.560
H-Hold it, Tang Rou.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.480
Have you quit looking for Feng Lang?

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.280
That can wait!

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.190
What should be our next move exactly?

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.190
Just come with me.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.330
Here it is. We've arrived.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.750
Look, what a beautiful dance.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.480
How lovely.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.159
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.750
This way, please.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.360
Okay.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.560
So beautiful.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.430
Bravo! Bravo!

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.670
Well done!

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.070
Do you like it?

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.330
I'm glad Your Highness is satisfied.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.480
This dance is newly choreographed.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.630
Go, Big Brother.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.800
Terrific.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.180
I'm thinking about the same thing as you.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.000
Big Brother, what do you think?

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:48.600
This is Qunfang House,
also known as a miniature of Qinhuai area.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.600
It's visited by numerous scholars
and martial practitioners.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.400
The scene setting does recreate

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.320
the description in the book.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.830
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.890
Big Brother.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.480
Big Brother?

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.290
Big Brother!

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.600
You seem a bit nervous. How come?

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.680
I think we should...

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.360
Aren't you Mr. Zuo? Long time no see.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.000
Greetings, gentlemen.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.950
Ma'am, lead us to a quiet place.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.480
Sure. Come on.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.390
Come right in.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.860
Let's go, Big Brother.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.390
This way, please.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.390
Hongye, Qingliu!

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.789
Yes!

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.150
Such powerful toxins.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.560
I can't believe
I'm not able to force them out.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.250
Even if I'm too weak to make a move,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.840
whoever tries to approach me
will have to die.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.750
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.720
Sir, a pot of good wine for that room.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.210
Sure. Just a second.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.840
Make way! Let us through!

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.720
Who are you, Sir?

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.030
What brings you here?

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.600
Someone killed a fellow of ours
and is hiding here.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.660
Stay out of our way!

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:34.650
The Power Gang?

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:36.210
Search!

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.220
The Power Gang?

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.080
Have they figured out

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.000
that I killed Fu Tianyi?

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.960
Search carefully, guys!

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.010
Go, step aside!

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.480
Search!

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.150
Make way!

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.030
Make way! Out of my way!

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.720
You can't just barge in, gentlemen.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.270
Move!

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.200
Make way!

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.790
Search carefully!

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.270
Search!

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.310
They took action so fast.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.470
Open the door!

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.000
You, go break it!

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.670
I'm sorry, buddy.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.480
I'll just hide in here for a moment.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.390
He's in there. Go!

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.510
Feng Lang?

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.720
He's my lucky bag, Feng Lang the NPC.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.320
Stop!

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.270
Who are you?
How dare you stand in our way?

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.240
When I see an injustice,
I'll stand up against it!

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.760
Take him down!

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:09.680
Catch the sword!

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.870
My muscle memory has completely awakened.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.870
I'm more skilled in martial arts now
than I was when fighting Fu Tianyi.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.910
It is nice to have run into Feng Lang.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.000
Big Brother!

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.290
Are you alright?

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.690
Big Brother,

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.120
why did you
beat them all down alone so soon?

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.380
Are you trying to gain a good reputation?

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.550
I got it.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.340
Everyone, take a look!

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.750
The third young master of Huanhua Sect
Xiao Qiushui has done a good deed.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.360
Spread the news around, please!

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.240
Spread it!

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.440
So that's Xiao Qiushui?

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.370
How impressive.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.380
Now I know it's him.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:17.750
Yeah.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.710
What an extraordinary fighter.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.390
Xiao Qiushui...

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.550
Huanhua Sect...

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:25.720
Shut up.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.390
Lad, do you know who you just saved?

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.680
He killed that man so quickly

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.540
that I couldn't catch a good look!

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.530
Who did you save?

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.890
A friend of mine, named Feng Lang.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.900
It's exactly the jade pendant

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.800
I wrote about.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.260
With each shake
comes a sound of pattering rain.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.150
The Rain Sword.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.030
Correct.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.030
It's him.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.760
The scar is in the same place as I wrote.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.150
The location and the keepsake
match the description.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.550
He must be the guy.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.680
[Bamboo]

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.510
Oh, you woke up. Don't move.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.750
Just stay in bed.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:05.680
You're injured.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.750
Who are you?

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.750
Answer my question first.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.160
Does this jade pendant belong to you?

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:23.440
Yes.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:28.030
I am Feng Lang,
the owner of the Rain Sword.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.640
It really is you.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:52.720
This stupid system
has finally done something right.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.510
Finally, my buddy.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.310
My dearest friend.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.310
Sir, Sir...

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.160
I'm terribly sorry.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.490
I got a bit carried away.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.960
Have we met before?

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.260
Now is not too late to get acquainted.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.810
Let me pour you some water.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.090
I have a few questions.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.440
Who taught you sword skills?
At what age did you start the training?

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.900
What do you like to do best?

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.550
Come on, have some water.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:36.280
I don't know.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.400
Y-You don't know?

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.350
H-Has your head been injured?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.030
Are you fishing for

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.000
information from me?

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.530
This lucky bag has been forcibly activated
by my presence.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.920
Maybe he just hasn't settled in.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.930
Lucky Bag,
I know you have excellent martial skills.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.040
But don't worry.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.400
Your secret is safe with me.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.510
You keep calling me "Lucky Bag."
What does it mean?

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.920
How should I put it?

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.590
I can't explain it to you right now.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:25.480
Anyway,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.960
you'll eliminate my enemies,
bring me precious items,

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.200
strategize for me,

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.650
and most importantly,
help me become the grandmaster.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.000
What now?

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.970
At the first sight of me,

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.720
didn't you feel an urge to protect me?

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.480
You want to be

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.830
my ride-or-die
and do anything for me, right?

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.490
Not really.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.730
Not really?

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.290
When I first saw you,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.880
I didn't think you'd live long.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.240
This is odd.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.270
The Feng Lang I wrote

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.790
would not only look for
the Infinite Pill for me,

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.200
but also transfer
all his martial power to me.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.720
Why is this character different now?

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.310
You don't consider me as a friend now,
do you?

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.240
Should I consider you as a friend?

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.300
I'm not his friend?

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.270
Has the lucky bag
not been activated yet?

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.590
It's fine.
Though you don't see me as a friend now,

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.850
soon you'll understand what I'm saying.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.590
Now, the focus should be
fixing your injuries.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.270
Water is there. Help yourself with it.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.600
I'll go get you a doctor.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.440
Feng Lang...

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.270
Xiao Qiushui...

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.720
Mr. Feng's external injuries
are not severe.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.790
But he seems to have been inflicted by

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.400
the Noxious Beetles.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.690
The Noxious Beetles?
Then it's a non-toxic poison.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.420
The only cure is also a non-toxic poison.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.510
I can't believe
the Power Gang would be so cruel to him.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.060
Xueyu is a miraculous doctor.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:15.790
Why don't you bring Feng Lang
back to Huanhua Sect for medical help?

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.190
The poison in him will kick in
within 3 days.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.160
There's no time for that.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.200
Within 3 days?

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.720
Then, what can we do?

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.070
Big Brother, I know a place—

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.000
the Wonder Liquor Villa.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.200
The owner there is known for
making miracle-working liquor.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.000
A kind of it is called "Nether Dew,"

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.550
which intoxicates the drinkers right away.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.930
It can be counted as a non-toxic poison.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:37.930
Sounds feasible.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.070
It only takes half a day to travel to

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.750
the Wonder Liquor Villa from here.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:45.510
Alright. Let's set off now.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.240
-Let's go.
-Wait, Big Brother.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.440
Who exactly is Feng Lang?

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.410
First, you saved him.
Now, you're trying to cure him.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.160
It's our duty

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.790
to help those in need.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.110
Big Brother, something's off with you.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.440
Yuhan,

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.370
I can't explain everything to you now.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.610
I need more helpers,

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.880
given the turmoil
in the martial world now.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.160
Alright. No more talking. Let's go.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.720
Mr. Feng, hang in there.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.300
We'll arrive soon.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.460
We barely know each other.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.200
Why are you so nice to me?

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.400
How should I explain it?

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.440
The truth might confuse you.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.320
At present, the priority

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.000
is to kindle our friendship.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.590
Is making friends with me that important?

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.430
How should I put it, Mr. Feng?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.960
Is it difficult to keep alive
in the martial world?

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.440
Yes, not easy at all.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.070
Right?

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.530
When I first came here,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.050
I had a really hard time.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.350
I'm seriously terrified when I think of

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.030
the future obstacles.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.640
Alright. Let's put that behind.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.080
Only when we become friends

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.910
in support of each other,

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:02.830
will we be able to go a bit further

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.040
in this hateful martial world.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.110
I see.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.440
If you help me get rid of
the poison in me,

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.000
I'll be your friend.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.040
Why's that forced smile?

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.750
Come on. A fist bump.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.720
What is it for?

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.600
Just to seal the deal.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.140
Never mind.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.830
Qiu, be quick! Guys, you're all doing

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:31.600
a good job!

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.500
We're almost there, Big Brother.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.890
So many people want the Nether Dew.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.030
Is it really that magical?

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:04.960
It is poison

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:06.590
if it is consumed directly.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.160
But when it is mixed with spring water,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.160
it'd taste like nectar.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.890
It is indeed world-class wine.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.440
Zuoqiu.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:16.640
Tang Rou,

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.720
take Mr. Feng to an inn,

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.330
so he can get some rest.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.940
Yuhan, Chaoran, let's go.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.340
Time to solve a challenge.

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.510
[Wonder Liquor Villa]

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.590
Here they come!

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.590
Look! Look at my vase!

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:44.920
It's a family heirloom.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.510
Please let me through.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.570
Sell the wine to me. I'll pay you gold!

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:52.110
Everybody, listen to me.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.110
There is only one jar of Nether Dew.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.590
-Here's what our master said.
-Only one jar?

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.320
He who offers
a rare and precious item can have it.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.510
Gold and houses are not exactly
rare and precious.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.130
I have what he wants.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:22.980
Who is this girl?

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.160
What kind of treasure is that?

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.110
Yeah.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.720
What is she holding?

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.680
When Sheye Kingdom collapsed
a century ago,

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.000
the legendary Sheye Blood Wine

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.110
disappeared as well.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.000
However, previously,

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.000
someone discovered a pot of it.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.680
Sheye Blood Wine
is truly a miraculous brew.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.640
Go ask your master if he wants it.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.110
He'd love to have it!

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.650
Miss, rare liquor is my master's favorite.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:11.480
Big Brother.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.200
Miss, come on in.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.510
H-Hold on!

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.640
I brought rare liquor here too.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.400
He has it too?

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.960
What kind of liquor is it then, Mister?

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.960
An unprecedented kind.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.350
In that case,

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.750
how did you get it?

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:38.790
It's my own creation.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.510
Your own creation?

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.070
Of course nobody would have tasted it.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.800
How is it deserved
to be called "unprecedented"?

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.650
I wouldn't have brought it here

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.740
to humiliate myself
if it wasn't special at all, right?

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.590
Sir, my liquor is truly rare.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.510
Have a glimpse of it,

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.920
and you'll know I'm telling the truth.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.550
Then please take it out and show it

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:07.550
to me now.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.050
The making of it won't be finished
until half a day later.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.750
It's not done yet?

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.680
Sir, this man is obviously lying.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.920
Do not waste time on him.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.400
Just give me the Nether Dew.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.330
Half a day later,

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:24.000
if my liquor proves to be ordinary,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.590
then I won't compete for the Nether Dew.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.750
But if my liquor is found to be unique,
Sir,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.240
I'm afraid your master will regret
not having it for the rest of his life.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.720
Alright. Take your time to mull it over.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.640
Guys, let's go.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.720
Hold on! Mister, please stay.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.440
Let's wait for half a day.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:48.590
Then, I'll ask my master

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.880
to taste both kinds of
allegedly special liquor.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.030
He will decide

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.240
who can have the Nether Dew.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:04.790
Thank you.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:12.110
Big Brother,
when did you learn to make liquor?

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:13.970
Yuhan... No. You're Chaoran.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:16.640
The clock is ticking. We all have tasks.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.690
I'll go buy some liquor now.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.440
You two will go get me some

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.240
slim bamboo tubes,
porcelain bottles and mint leaves.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:23.880
Oh, right.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.030
Buy sugar and salt as well.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.160
Bamboo tubes, mint leaves, sugar...

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.000
Wait, Big Brother,

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.350
are you sure
you can fix a drink with those?

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.160
Go do it now.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:35.270
No more dawdling.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.650
Excuse me. Where can I buy liquor?

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.410
Over there.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.830
Thank you.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.200
It's been half a day.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.510
I think that man is just a fraud.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.770
He told a lie,
and now he has chickened out.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.080
No need to wait for him anymore.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.830
In that case, please come with me.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:06.480
Wait!

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.110
Master, the guests have arrived.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.750
Let them in.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:34.590
Yes.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.510
Please come in!

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.610
Greetings, Sir.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.000
Greetings, Sir.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.740
[Master of Wonder Liquor Villa]

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.080
You both brought liquor?

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:02.240
-Sir.
-S...

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.730
I have a pot of Sheye blood wine.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.200
Master.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.400
Good. No wonder it's a legend.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.680
It's mellow with a lingering aftertaste.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.200
So exotic.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.060
Mister, care to present your liquor?

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.550
Sir, there is a whole process

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.350
to go through before you taste

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:22.550
my liquor.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.240
Sir.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.680
Master.

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:02.640
Master.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.670
What's the name of this?

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:33.440
People are bothered by many a thing.
A sip of it will take all worries away.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.230
This

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.800
is called "Mogito."

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.280
I got drunk in the mansion.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.000
I dreamed about a beauty
beyond description.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.590
When I sobered up with inspiration,

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.510
gone with my worries was desperation.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.710
Mogito... How brilliant!

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.590
Master,

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.090
doest it taste good?

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:39.670
In terms of taste,

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:41.750
it's like any other spirits.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:47.760
But the sweet citrus juice

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.070
complements the spirits

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.220
and adds a twist to the mouthfeel.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:58.360
In particular,
the final touch of salt and mint

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.110
is an extremely bold choice!

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:06.510
Such a delicious drink

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.000
has gone beyond my wildest imagination!

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:13.590
Good. It's amazing!

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.480
Hold on!

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.630
This man has clearly resorted to

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:19.630
a trick of deceit.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.070
Liquor is liquor.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.150
With the miscellaneous ingredients
you put in it,

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.480
is it even liquor or not?

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.820
The taste of liquor matters most.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.710
Why bother where the taste is from?

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.560
Don't you think so, Sir?

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.260
You're right, Mister.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.280
Grandpa! Grandpa!

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:41.510
Grandpa! Grandpa!

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.140
We want to drink it too!

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.070
Children can't drink alcohol.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.130
I'm in a pickle now.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.360
Mister, any idea?

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:57.150
Kids,

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.600
not everyone can drink alcohol.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.400
Come here.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:01.070
Go.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.670
Let me fix you a different drink.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:27.850
Alright.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:30.590
Now, try it.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.480
Take a sip.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.320
Is it good?

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.920
-Yes.
-So tasty.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.030
Grandpa, what is it?

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.150
Grandpa, it's tasty!

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:46.000
If you like it,

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:47.240
drink some more. Go!

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:48.070
Yes!

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.710
Careful.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.800
Mister, what is that?

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.880
B-Boba milk tea.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:04.410
Devious means.

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.360
Miss, your wine worked up my appetite.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.590
But this young man's drink
gave me inspiration.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.440
I thought I had reached the ultimate level

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.670
of making liquor,

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.250
and there wouldn't be more progress.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.360
That made me feel aimless.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.880
Now, I've finally

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.280
realized there are territories

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.800
in the world of liquor
that I haven't charted.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.590
There is so much I need to work on.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.670
Mister, may I have your name?

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:39.550
I'm Xiao Qiushui from Huanhua Sect.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:44.190
What an admirable young man.
I appreciate what you've done.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.230
Butler!

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.690
Yes, Master.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.760
Return the Sheye Blood Wine
to this young lady

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:52.350
and give her a thousand taels of silver.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:53.190
Yes.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.190
The Nether Dew is yours now, Mr. Xiao.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.360
T-Thank you.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.460
Who would've known

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.070
your Mogito could work?

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.960
I thought we'd be kicked out.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.960
Big Brother,

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.480
no wonder you asked for
different types of bottles.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.510
They were used to distill liquids
and concentrate alcohol.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.230
Too bad

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.160
that I didn't get a sip of Mogito.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.030
You like that?

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.040
I'll make some for you later.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.440
I finally got this stuff.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.710
Foul mouth, plus a veiled face.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.630
People with those features
are usually awful.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.550
Trying to rob me after you lost
—are you a bandit?

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.740
Give me the Nether Dew.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.320
What? Are you going to snatch it from us

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.500
in plain daylight?

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:55.190
Yes.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.110
Watch out!

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.030
-Big Brother! Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.590
I'm fine.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.880
She has hidden weapons. Be careful.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:10.590
Fang!

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:12.880
Fang!

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.810
What are you doing here?

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.300
What about you?

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.360
"Fang"?

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.340
-"Fang"?
-I'm having a tour with my friends.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:24.140
Fang, this is Xiao Qiushui. Come with me.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.000
So the man you've been hanging out with

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.200
is him—Xiao Qiushui?

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.190
Fang, Qiushui treats me well.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.320
Qiushui!
This is my older sister Tang Fang.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.280
[Tang Fang, from Tang Sect]

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.400
Tang Rou,
you've fallen in with a bad crowd.

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:54.480
Fang, what do you want the Nether Dew for?

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.130
Out of my way.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.630
Fang, Qiushui is a friend of mine.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:01.830
Please don't be rude.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:04.510
Tang Rou!

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.500
I won't leave you in a dilemma.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.220
Here is the Nether Dew.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.810
Miss, you have to snatch it, right?

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:17.360
Give it to me.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.210
If I drop it, neither of us can have it.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:22.800
You...

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.670
Fang,

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.630
Qiushui needs the Nether Dew

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.590
to save a friend's life.

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:28.510
I don't know

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:29.920
what you want it for,

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.110
but I'm sure

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:33.530
a human life matters most. Right?

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.110
The Iron Army

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.960
asks for the Nether Dew as a gift.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:44.920
It is for opening the Omniscience Door.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.710
Isn't it more important than a human life?

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.000
Tang Rou,

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.900
what is she talking about?

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.320
When the Iron Army takes action,
there has to be a result.
