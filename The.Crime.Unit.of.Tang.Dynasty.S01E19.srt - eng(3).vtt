WEBVTT

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:20.291
Unlucky wretch.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:22.250
The master said not to burn joss paper for Madam.

00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:23.333
Do you have a death wish?

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:24.375
No, Steward Liu.

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:30.375
Madam was always kind to me when she was alive.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.500
Stop talking and keep watch.

00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:47.875
Let me gamble one more time.

00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:48.625
I'm begging you.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.750
I can win it back for sure.

00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:50.708
I will win it back.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.875
Please, I'm begging you.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.125
Let me gamble one more time.

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:54.333
Just one more bet, please.

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:55.750
I swear I can win it back.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.625
Good luck, sir.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.916
Where is my wife?

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:32.166
Go back and you'll see your wife.

00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:12.375
Lin Xiaoran

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.333
As soon as I arrived in Chang'an County,

00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:17.250
I heard that Madam Shen came back to life on the seventh night after her death.

00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:18.416
What do you think about this?

00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:21.166
There’s nothing too strange in this world.

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:22.666
This trick of reviving the dead

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.000
I’d like to see it for myself.

00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:35.458
Nephew, what brings you here today?

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.916
About the Sand Ghost Case I investigated earlier,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.416
I’d like to ask for your help with the procedures, Uncle.

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:42.250
No need to mention it.

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:43.875
It’s all part of my duty.

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:45.916
I passed by Xianyun Zhai,

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.500
and brought some snow pear soup for Aunt.

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:50.666
I wonder if Aunt will like it.

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:52.708
You’re very thoughtful.

00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:53.708
But unfortunately,

00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:55.083
the household is busy today.

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:57.125
We won’t keep you both.

00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:02.666
Snow pear soup is my favorite.

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.125
Since you’re both here,

00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:06.666
why not stay for a meal?

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:07.750
Sure.

00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.375
Aunt suffered from a cough for years.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.041
But now she’s perfectly fine.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.833
Could you share some advice?

00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:17.750
I’d like to help ease my adoptive father’s illness too.

00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:20.958
It was just a folk remedy from a wandering healer.

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:24.000
I’ve also learned many folk remedies in the Jianghu.

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:25.750
Including the bone-feeling diagnosis technique.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.166
Let me examine Madam.

00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:32.458
There’s no sign of disguise on her face.

00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:34.416
Her pulse is perfectly normal.

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:36.416
That’s enough.

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:38.458
You’ve seen what you needed.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.583
We won’t keep you. See them out.

00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:46.083
Uncle.

00:04:48.833 --> 00:04:49.375
Well?

00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:50.916
No sign of alteration on her face.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.500
Doesn’t look like someone pretending.

00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:02.875
Boss, I found a clue.

00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:11.666
Sir,

00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:14.583
I’m telling the truth.

00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:18.000
I really saw Madam come back to life.

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:19.708
I wouldn’t dare lie.

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:25.541
They’re coming, they’re coming!

00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:31.291
Master.

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:33.125
Madam.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.333
My husband has returned.

00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:44.875
Madam looks and acts exactly as before.

00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:47.625
She doesn’t look sick at all.

00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:50.958
She truly came back from the dead.

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.416
Do you believe his nonsense?

00:06:01.083 --> 00:06:03.458
I can’t explain supernatural things.

00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:06.083
But even if he’s telling the truth,

00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.041
bringing the dead back to life is nearly impossible.

00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:13.333
I just saw a totem on Shen Wanyan’s hand.

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:15.541
I’ve never seen it before.

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:18.291
You’ve seen enough, we won’t keep you.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.416
See them out.

00:06:21.708 --> 00:06:24.708
Is this what the totem looks like?

00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:38.750
Yes, that’s the one.

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:40.250
Where did this token come from?

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.791
It looked interesting, so I took it from Shen Wanyan’s study.

00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:45.000
Oh, right.

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:46.041
Why are you here?

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.333
She’s always elusive.

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:48.125
You’re still not used to it.

00:06:48.166 --> 00:06:51.416
I heard there’s a resurrection show at the Shen residence.

00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:53.041
Of course I had to come and see.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.791
This matter might be very complicated.

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:00.083
Gather all the brothers.

00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:02.166
Secretly investigate every gambling house and tavern.

00:07:02.666 --> 00:07:04.458
See if anyone recognizes this token.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.125
Be careful not to alert the enemy.

00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:06.958
Yes.

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:12.000
Shut your mouth.

00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:12.833
Stop shouting.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.416
This kid is really improving.

00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:18.875
Shut up, I get it.

00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:24.125
You should see who he’s following.

00:09:24.166 --> 00:09:25.875
Are you looking for me?
