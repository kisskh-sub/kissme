00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.560
Good morning, babe!

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.160
Who's your "babe"?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.320
Why are you laughing?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200
Listen to the pet name you're calling.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.560
It's strange.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.600
Well, people need to call their partner
by a pet name.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.360
Unless...

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.760
you wanna call me something else?

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.840
Pookie,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.760
honey bee,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.000
boo,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.040
darling,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.440
littie,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.720
or biggie?

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.760
Anything you want, babe.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.360
None of that.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.000
Can we just not use pet names?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.120
Well, I just want
a special name to call you by.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.360
Hm...

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.080
A special name?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.080
Actually...

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.880
I like when you call me by my name.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.120
But isn't that too basic?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.560
Please, Print?

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.680
I wanna hear you say my name.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.280
Fine.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.560
Good morning, Rey.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.760
From now on,
we'll call each other by our names.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.320
That's good.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.920
Print and Rey.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280
That's enough, Print.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.120
Go get yourself ready.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.120
Nah!

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.600
There's no need to rush it.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.200
It's the weekend.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.920
I wanna hug you all day long, Rey!

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.120
But Print,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.000
I don't want to hear your stomach
growling all day long.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.280
Go take a shower!

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.280
Are you gonna grab the bowls?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Let me help.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.840
Why didn't you call me
by my name this time?

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.240
That's standoffish.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.840
Oh...

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.240
Well...

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.880
I'm not quite used to it yet.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.440
Rey,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.040
can I have your phone?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.840
Why do you need it?

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.520
Just something people do
with someone special.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.000
Here.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.320
[Rey]

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.000
Meow!

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.400
Here.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.560
And...

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.080
where's yours, Print?

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.400
[Print]

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.960
Meow!

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.440
Here.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.760
I'm burning up.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.840
Maybe I just need some time.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.320
That smells heavenly!

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.920
Big bite!

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.080
You're making a mess!

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.160
'Sup! What are you...

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.120
Yo! Where is my thing...

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.520
Oh! Found it!

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.000
What are you guys up to?

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.280
Having rice porridge...

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.120
Okay.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.680
Nothing! I'm just...

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.320
stopping by to give Rey the products
to review.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.360
But...

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.480
just finish whatever you're doing
before working.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Whoops!

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.000
I just got called by the mother ship!

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.120
I'm just gonna leave.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.280
Yeah, I'd better leave.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.320
Do you think...

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.000
we should tell Fon and Mai
about us?

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.480
Should we wait for the right moment?

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.120
What about today

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.600
when we're both free,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.520
is there anything special
you want to do with me, Rey?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.360
Look!

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.280
I think this dress
will look good on you, Rey.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.800
It suits you!

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.600
It feels like you're choosing an outfit
for yourself.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.480
What do you think about this?

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.600
I'll go try it on, then.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.320
I'm coming with you!

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.040
Turn the other way!

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.360
Why are you taking so many photos?

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.880
Nope, I'm taking photos of myself!

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.080
Hey, are you gonna delete them, Rey?

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.400
No,

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.040
I'm not.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.280
Just why would you take a picture alone
when you have a girlfriend?

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.720
Hey,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.600
it's alright.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.640
I'm not cold, Print.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.680
- You keep it on.
- No, Rey, you take it.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.720
No, you keep it.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.560
- You take it.
- You keep it.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.400
Let's both wear it.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.360
I'm a little cold, actually.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.720
Mai,

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.560
what are you doing here all alone?

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.600
Aren't thoseâ€¦

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.120
Print and Rey?

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.080
I thought they didn't have a schedule
together today.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.240
They didn't.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.320
Well,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.800
maybe they were just hanging out.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240
"Hanging out"?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.280
Since when did they get so close?

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.520
Well,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.560
after people work together,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.400
it's normal
that they get closer, isn't it?

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.960
I think that's for the better,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.280
unless you want them to fight.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.720
No.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.920
[Rey]

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.680
Hey, what are you doing?

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.840
Mai, it's the weekend.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.800
Give them just a break
to do whatever they want.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.320
No need to check on them.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.160
Well...

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.960
Let's just say

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.200
you'll be drinking with me tonight.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.960
Even though I'm not one of your lovers,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I guess you don't mind
drinking with me as a friend,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.040
do you?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.600
People who have a drink with me

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.600
don't usually end up
calling me a friend.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.480
Excuse me,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200
can I have one more glass?

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.400
It's just like when we run away
from the security guard.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.680
It's just like
when we tried to switch back.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.440
Do you remember that?

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.560
Mm,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.600
apparently, nothing worked.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.480
Maybe we weren't getting close enough.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.240
Well, then,
should we try again?

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.440
Should we try getting even closer?

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.080
Mm.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.720
Let's take turns.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.840
There's one more method to try.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.880
Wanna check it out?

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.360
[Are you prepared
for the Moon and the Star to reunite?]

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.600
- Rey!
- Hm?

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.400
Isn't this suspicious, Print?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.240
Where did the last pic go?

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.760
Uh... Um...

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.640
It tore off when it was printed.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.440
Maybe...
the machine needs a little TLC?

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.520
Alright, let me see that.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.800
"Are you prepared...

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.720
for the Moon and the Star to reunite?"

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.480
The link to download the photos...

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.280
is actually a location on Google Maps?

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.480
Mm.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.160
Yeah, but...

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.840
there's no location found.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.840
What?

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.440
This is 100% a clue
from the Mysterious Person.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.280
But if it's truly time for us
to switch back,

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.000
why didn't she provide us
with the location?

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.880
Maybe it's not the time
for the Moon and the Star to reunite.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.280
How?

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.400
Maybe it's this: planetary parade,

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.520
the day when the Moon and the stars
in the solar system align.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.800
And this parade thing,

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.800
when will it happen?

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.080
Next week.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.160
Huh?!

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.720
If we successfully switched back,

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.560
what would be the first thing you do?

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.400
Hm...

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.720
Weighing myself!

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.240
This whole body switch thing
is pretty nice.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.680
If this never happened,

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.400
we wouldn't have understood each other.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680
Hm...

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.960
Print, can I ask you something?

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.720
When did you stop hating me?

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.800
Hey,

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.040
you still think I hated you, Rey?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.800
Listen up, Rey,

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.920
I've never, ever hated you.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.520
You didn't hate me,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.000
but you disliked me, didn't you?

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.160
If I'm being completely honest,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.680
there were times.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.840
What about you, Rey?

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.480
When did you stop hating me?

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080
I have no clue.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.440
Next thing I knew,
those feelings were gone.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.720
Maybe what I felt for you

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.640
wasn't hatred to begin with.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.400
It might be better called

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.240
"envy."

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.200
What?

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.800
Someone like you

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.640
was envious of me?

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.440
Mm, since you're...

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.880
always so smart

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.080
and loved by everyone.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.480
Whatever you do

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.560
seems so natural.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.760
Also, everything about you
is just prettier:

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.840
your eyebrows,

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.320
your eyes,

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.880
your nose,

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.000
and your lips.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.880
Maybe...

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
you just didn't take the time
to look at yourself.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.480
Why don't you...

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.200
take a good look at your face

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.520
and see the beauty beneath it?

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.720
Back then,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.200
I hated the mole under my eyes.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.880
But on another look,

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.200
it's quite unique.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.440
I'm now getting envious
of myself

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.200
for having a girlfriend like you.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.160
Uh...

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.280
should we wait
until after switching back?

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.240
We should.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.080
It feels a bit off.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.640
But, as of today...

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.160
can we cuddle, Rey?

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.560
In only a week, we will return
to our normal selves.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.960
When the time comes...

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.640
I will really get to hug you.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.000
Mm.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.640
Then, for the rest of this week,

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.760
I leave it to you
to live my life to the fullest

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.360
as a farewell.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.000
Come.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.800
Don't let me fall!

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.800
I've never been to an audition
this serious before!

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.880
I'm all fired up!

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.320
This movie is a big project for Thay.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.440
The director himself has been wanting
to work with Rey.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.600
It was only recently
that we've got the schedule sorted.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.280
Do your best.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.600
I don't want Rey
to miss this opportunity.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.520
Hello, Rey.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.800
Hi, Nicha!

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.640
Hi.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.120
What an honor
meeting you in person.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.080
I love your performance in
Sunrise at Chaophraya.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.160
You keep up with the drama I played in?

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.120
Whoa, my mom and I are your big fans!

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.760
We always watch your work together!

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.120
Rey, you ready?

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.000
You can take a moment to focus.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.800
Do you think it's a little off?

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.600
Yeah, I kinda do,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.240
but I don't know exactly why.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.840
I think the soundtrack is out of place.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.920
It doesn't get along
with the vibe of the video.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.640
Yeah!

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.400
But...how can we work this out?

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.760
We need to send this
to the client this evening.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.760
Hm...

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.120
Is there any more footage?

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.680
Could you send it to me?

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.400
I might figure it out.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.760
Okay. I'm sending it now.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.440
You can edit videos?

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.560
I do.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.200
When I go on vacation,
I love taking videos

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.920
and editing them.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.880
How come you're so good
on and off camera?!

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.880
Girl, don't keep your talents
to yourself!

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.320
Right...

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:55.240
I have 2-3 more products
that Print needs to review...

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.560
Do you want to help me
come up with ideas for the pitch?

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.840
Certainly!

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.680
I'd like to try it.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.080
Okay, then! Let's try it!

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.480
- Let's settle for this one first.
- Mm!

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.360
Alright.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.000
Whoa!

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.400
Is this your last supper or what?

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.040
I'm sorry, Print.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.200
I got so caught up in work

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.000
that I forgot to eat,

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.960
so I'm making up for it now.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.040
Have you been busy all day?

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.760
No,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.760
but I got to try my hand at some editing

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.680
and coming up with new ideas...

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.840
The latter was really fun!

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:58.040
I know it's gonna turn out wonderful!

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.480
How was the audition today, Print?

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.360
You'll jump off the couch

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.640
when you know
who you're gonna work with!

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.040
Who is it?

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.760
Who?

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.600
Nicha!

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.840
- Aww!
- Aww!

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.960
The script is also top-notch,

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.040
and the character is
very well-developed.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.000
I've only read a few pages,

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.680
and I'm already in love with her!

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.560
- You are?
- Madly!

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.720
Mm...

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.240
I'm a little sad, you know?

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.440
We've only been together for a few days

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.560
and now you're falling for someone else.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.400
That's not what I meant!

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.520
Just kidding!

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.360
Really?

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.320
Mm.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.640
Then, this is what you get!

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:56.760
Hey!

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.040
Stop it.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.360
Stop.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.800
Cut it.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.800
If we switch back tomorrow,

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.880
you're gonna pay for this.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.120
I surrender.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.360
Thank you, Rey.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.720
After all the time you spent in my body,

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.200
you really are the better version of me.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.040
Thank you, too, Print.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.000
Mm!

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.520
Can I...
have some crab sticks?

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.400
Of course!

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.160
You can have all of them.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.600
This one or that one?

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.920
Excuse me,

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.600
will we ever get a flower

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.280
if all you do is smile?

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.680
Well, I have to do my best
for such a special occasion.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.520
Well...

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.960
I guess
I'll be the only one dying single.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.480
What?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
What did you find out?

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.760
Girl!

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.200
What didn't I find out?

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.560
I've known about
you and Rey for a while.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.520
How?!

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.600
Do you even realize

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.960
it's written on your foreheads

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
that you like each other?!

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.960
Took the chance to roast me, huh?

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.560
Wait your turn!

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.040
'Cause if you ever make up
with that lady,

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.800
I'll roast you for sure!

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.800
I'm the kind of person
who moves ahead,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.880
not in circles.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:07.720
Let's see who you move on to.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.680
Pick up the flowers
and get your things done!

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.920
Wanmai and 'your Rey'...
are waiting.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.600
That girl's biting the hand
that feeds her.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.640
Excuse me,

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.680
but I think I'll need tons of flowers.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.200
Do you guys do delivery?

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.560
[See you there]

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.080
Hello, Thay.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.480
Alright, sir.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.200
Why are you so happy?

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:54.880
Not telling you.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.600
So you're keeping secrets
from me now, Print?

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.840
It's not a surprise
if you know!

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.920
Yes, yes.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.800
Alright.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.880
Goodbye.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.360
Rey,

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.800
the client just called

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.920
and approved your ideas.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.040
Does this mean they've confirmed?

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.120
Yes! Good job!

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.280
Thank you, Thay.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.240
Of course.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:32.920
Print,

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.280
Print, the project you auditioned for...

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.040
You got the role.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:37.960
Whoa!

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.240
Seriously?

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.240
I'll be a part of the film?

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.360
Mm.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.840
"Rey"

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.680
will be a part of the film.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.800
Then...

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.240
Print, you'll be taking over

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.440
the ideas that Rey came up with.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.600
Okay?

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.320
Is this really the place, Mai?

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.920
This feels more spooky than magical...

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.240
The Mysterious Person...

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.200
Alright...

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.440
Follow my lead.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.480
Do not waste more time.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.280
Sit right down.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.680
Come.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.800
Hey,

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.240
do you wish to switch with them, too?

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.880
Go wait on the side.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.080
You two...

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.160
hold hands,

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.560
and look into each other's eyes.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.080
Like so.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.040
Think of your deepest desire...

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.520
Think of the life you want to return to.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.120
Kindred souls,

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.800
return to where you belong.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.840
I am me,

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.840
you are you.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.920
Letting myself relax
in a nice Jacuzzi tub...

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.640
Wearing pretty clothes...

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.440
Please welcome, Rey!

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.720
You are you.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.840
It feels great to eat good food
while we're switching bodies.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.040
The latter was really fun!

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.040
I just know
it's gonna come out wonderful!

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.480
Cut! That was awesome.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.240
Why...

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.680
are you still her, and she is still you?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
What do you mean?

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.480
It's not yet time
for the Moon and Star to shift,

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.160
as they still need to learn
about each other.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.280
Excuse me,

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.520
I don't know why you're doing all this,

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.600
but we don't have time
for your stupid games!

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.280
Switch them back right now!

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.320
Whenever you discover the answers
your hearts are longing for,

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.840
the time shall come
for the Moon and the Star...

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.040
to return home.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.040
I'm really sorry, Print.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.160
I thought about something else
during the ritual.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.640
It wasn't just you, Rey.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.880
I did, too...

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.320
I'm sorry, Rey.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.560
It's gonna be fine.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.960
The Mysterious Person assured us

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.920
that if we find
the answers to our hearts,

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.040
the ritual will be a success.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.520
But...

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.600
what if we couldn't find one?

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.520
We'll then be stuck
in each other's bodies...

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.600
forever.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.840
What freaking answers do they need?

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.560
They already found each other!

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.400
I don't think it's about them
being together.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.000
You knew about them,
yet didn't say anything?

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.040
How is that even possible?

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.040
It's nothing to be concerned about,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.600
since what the two feel
is only because of intimacy,

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.160
not real love.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.280
I think you're looking down
on their love too much.

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.680
If we can find a way to
help them return to their bodies,

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.400
and they get to live their lives,

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.680
they'll forget about those things.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.600
"Forget about those things,"
you said?

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.320
Is this also...

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.800
what you thought about us back then?

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.280
Rey, wait!

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.040
Whoa...

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.920
Everything goes wrong!

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.240
I thought the ritual
was gonna be a success.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.040
If we switched back by that time...

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.560
It would've been romantic.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.840
So I asked Frank
to help with the surprise.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.440
But...

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.760
even though it didn't go as planned...

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.080
It's still our 10-day anniversary.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.560
Thank you.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.360
Follow me!

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.960
There's more upstairs!

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.400
And why did you go with pink roses?

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.160
Do you want an honest answer?

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.640
I just didn't know
what your favorite flower is.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.200
So you went with...

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.520
your favorite flower?

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.480
But pink roses are really meaningful!

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.160
It means...

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.800
a love that deserves to be cherished.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.680
That's how I feel for you.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.440
I wanna cherish you...

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.560
and never want you to be sad again.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.520
Or even if you are ever feeling down,

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.160
I want to be the one by your side.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.360
Mm.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.880
Could you love me
even while overlooking the fact

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.960
that this is your body?

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.200
All I can say is

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.360
I'm so into you

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.240
that...

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.320
I don't only see myself.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.760
I see you, Rey.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.320
Who do you see in that mirror, Rey?
