[Footprints of Change]

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.720
[Episode 17]

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.950
Come in.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.590
Minister Wen,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.590
I'm here to take your measurements.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.520
Alright.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.360
Well...

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.600
Let's just do it here.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.240
Okay.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.360
Please raise your arms.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.490
Just hold your arms straight out.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.010
So many measurements.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.020
Don't you need to write them down?

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.000
I keep them in my head.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.930
Please put your arms down.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.270
That's a lot of numbers to remember.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.680
It's just one person's measurements.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.810
I can remember them.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.970
Come on. Keep up.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.590
Minister, Director Fang said

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.360
we should take
the suit measurements here. Is that right?

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.840
Yes.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.750
There are too many people.
Let's go to the conference room.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.910
Okay. Let's go.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.079
The conference room works too.

00:03:59.079 --> 00:03:59.520
Your measurements are done.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.910
It doesn't matter where we do it.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.440
Let's go.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.890
Please have a seat.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.680
May I?

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.880
Of course.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.870
I'm really curious—

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.510
your landscapes

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.190
have a touch of the French impressionist
Monet,

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.610
but your portraits,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.310
especially this one of the female worker,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.240
show the influence

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.490
of the Soviet realist Repin.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.640
How do you manage

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.970
to combine both?

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.780
Can you stop drinking this fancy stuff?

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.750
Can it even fill your stomach?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.920
I drink it too.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.050
It's delicious.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.360
You live here now.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.920
It's different
from where you lived before.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.250
You must maintain good relationships
with your neighbors.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.120
Your voice is too low. We can't hear you.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.000
During the Eastern Jin Dynasty...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.310
Later, the common people all began to use…

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.110
Minister Wen?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.000
What brings you here?

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.630
Thank you.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.730
I know

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.360
your sense of aesthetics is different

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.260
from theirs.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.720
That's an objective fact.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.560
But I think

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.960
you can guide them, right?

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.760
How did you know I'm not leaving?

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.240
I mean...

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.200
if you weren't leaving.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.360
This pen…

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.960
I've used it for a while.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.370
It feels good in the hand.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.810
I want you to have it.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.020
I hope you'll stay

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.360
and keep creating.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.480
Minister Wen?

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.570
Are you just passing by?

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.920
Yes,

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.870
I am.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.890
What book are you reading?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.159
A biography of Van Gogh.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.390
You won't like it.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.310
Why not?

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.270
Van Gogh

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.659
was too sensitive.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.110
Artists

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.820
are all too sensitive.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.510
But for an artist,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.560
sensitivity

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:00.160
isn't a bad thing.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.470
Today,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.390
I actually have something to tell you.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.720
You don't need to say it.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.070
Why?

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.920
You know what I'm going to say?

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.270
I do.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.750
Director Fang already told me.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.510
Don't worry.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.140
I'll take good care of myself.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.840
I'll work hard

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.200
and live well.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.200
I'll be fine.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:43.080
I know

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.480
you're strong.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.200
No one

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.580
can easily change you.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.730
Well then...

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.470
I'll head back now.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.960
I'm leaving too.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.690
Yi.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.980
Let me introduce you.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.810
This is Xu Ke,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.120
my college professor.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.660
He's a great poet, very talented.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.460
This is my sister-in-law, Yi Yi.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.550
Didn't you say you were going out

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.120
with your classmates today?

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.360
I heard you'd be there too,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.690
so I asked to come along.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.930
Do we know each other?

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.460
Qing told me all about you.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.270
It's my honor to go on a spring outing

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.270
with you today.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.700
Professor Xu,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.730
go after her.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.460
Your bike!

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.080
Your bike.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.280
Professor.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.510
Ms. Yi,

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.490
why aren't you joining us?

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.450
I'm fine just watching you from here.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.670
June in Shanghai

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.370
is my favorite time of year.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.300
Look at the sky,

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.720
the trees,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.240
the wind,

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.510
the grass,

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.320
and the river.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.150
When they all come together,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.150
they stir something in my heart.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.010
What about you?

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.870
My mood doesn't change with the seasons.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.000
Qing told me a couple of days ago

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.330
that I'd meet you today,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.480
so I wrote a poem especially for you.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.750
I think our resonance as intellectuals

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.960
often lies in words.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.070
Let me read it for you.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:12.620
Spring rain

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.320
coaxes the peach blossoms to smile;

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.670
summer nights

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.150
send off the day's clamor;

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.280
autumn wind scatters
the sorrow of fallen leaves;

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.630
winter snow

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.730
drapes the earth in silver.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.250
Yet there is one more sight—

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.110
a river

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.330
of gentle starlight—

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.390
that's the grace of your smile.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.460
Your smile

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.970
lights up my day,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.210
brighter than a thousand suns.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.360
Your smile

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.200
lights up my day,

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.600
brighter than a thousand suns.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.240
Ms. Yi,

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:03.730
this is for you.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.000
Thank you.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.870
I think my poem

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.920
is quite ordinary in technique,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.600
but I believe

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.960
it's rich with emotion.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.920
So it doesn't sound too bad.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.240
What kind of emotion?

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.560
My admiration for you.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.540
You don't even know me yet.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.080
Why do you admire me?

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.120
So, what do you think?

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.380
He's talented, right?

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:44.790
It's yours.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.110
You don't like it?

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.120
She probably doesn't like pink.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.620
Secretary Zhao,

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.020
try this foreign liquor.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.870
Secretary Zhao,

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.040
my Mercedes

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.670
drives pretty well, right?

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.510
Nowadays,
all the young girls in Shanghai love it.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.320
What's it called?

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.120
Mercadas?

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.360
Mercedes.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.000
Not bad.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.480
When I press the pedal...

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.480
it feels so good.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.910
It's like an arrow.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.550
Just like when I used to

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.670
charge on horseback in battle.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.510
As we say in my hometown,

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.360
it's

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:39.240
mighty fine,

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:39.960
durn good.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.960
Durn good!

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.470
Here.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.270
I still can't get used to
this foreign stuff.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.000
Here.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.610
We have Chinese wine here.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.670
No wonder they say

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.800
you really know cars, Secretary Zhao.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.600
As you know,

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.320
leaving a car parked for too long

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.870
is bad for the engine.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.840
I don't drive

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.320
that Mercedes much.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.600
Secretary Zhao,
please drive it a few more days.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.120
Let's drink.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.400
Here's to you.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.770
Secretary Zhao,

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.090
with the courage this drink gives me,

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.670
let me speak frankly.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:35.720
Go ahead.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.510
I don't think

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.270
you seem like an official.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.670
As a provincial party secretary,

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.480
you should enjoy

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.720
the treatment
that comes with the position.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.790
Just look at the officials before you—

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.590
they were so full of themselves.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.270
I've said too much.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.480
Secretary Zhao.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.230
Mr. Fu.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.560
What you said is true.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.480
Let me tell you,

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.850
this country was won by us.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.560
Yes.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.790
Back when we fought the Japanese,

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.990
we stayed for days and nights

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.720
in caves

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.390
and tunnels,

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.610
without a bite to eat.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.430
So now if I eat and drink a little,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:15.960
that's not too much to ask, is it?

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.150
Of course not.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.570
Here's to you, Secretary Zhao.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:24.750
Besides, I'm at least

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.290
the top official in the region.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.390
Here.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:30.910
One more drink.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.390
That's enough.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:35.910
After this drink,

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:37.910
I should be going.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.670
Secretary Zhao,

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.870
this watch is so old.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.550
Why are you still wearing it?

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.610
What are you doing?

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.200
This one

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.000
matches more

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.290
with that "Mercadas."

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.050
No, no.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:55.320
Just listen to me.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.200
Secretary Zhao.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.030
This isn't appropriate.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.690
Come on.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.550
It goes perfectly

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:00.680
with that Mercedes.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.140
The young girls

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.200
like it even more.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.670
Come on, let's drink up.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:10.600
Is that so?

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.270
Here's to you.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.930
If you need anything, feel free to ask.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:23.990
Alright, alright.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.080
Yang,

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.910
after this meal,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.170
we'll say our temporary goodbyes.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.790
When you get there, you must work hard.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:37.490
Yes.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.270
Do your best.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:40.240
Alright.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:40.840
Goodbye.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.390
Say goodbye to Minister Wen too.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:42.670
Yes.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:43.840
Goodbye, Minister Wen.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.700
Director Fang,

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.600
no matter where I go,

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.200
I'll always be your student.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.670
I won't let you down.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.080
Minister Wen,

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.690
during this past time

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.940
working with you,

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:54.810
I really

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.490
caused you quite a lot of trouble.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.460
I realize

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.000
I was too young

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.320
and always eager for quick results.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.510
In my new position,

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.960
I'll be humble, patient,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.109
self-reflective,

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:08.440
and diligent in my work.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.589
And...

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.920
I also want to give you some advice.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.750
You're always so busy with work.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.410
Please remember to eat on time

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.609
and get enough rest.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:17.690
Anything else?

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.550
That's all.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.079
Thank you.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.869
Work hard.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:25.920
I'm leaving now, Director.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.980
Let's shake hands.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.430
Work hard.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.030
Let's go.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.000
Goodbye, Minister Wen.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.920
Okay. Goodbye.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:33.630
Goodbye.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.510
Goodbye.

Wen Pu, where are you going?

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.440
Wen Pu.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.810
What are you looking at?

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.690
This is Fu Zihe's car, isn't it?

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.960
I've ridden in it before.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.360
I heard
it's the only Mercedes in Shanghai.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:06.990
Strange.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.310
The license plate is different.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.780
The license plate is different?

[Shengli Garment Factory]

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:24.930
Yi.

Yi.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.350
Let's have dinner together tonight.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.280
Don't you have a date with Mr. Yang?

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.510
My date with Mr. Yang

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.640
won't conflict with your dinner
with Professor Xu.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.440
Sounds good.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.110
The Italian restaurant here
is very authentic.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.770
I'd like to invite you, Ms. Yi.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.730
No thanks, Professor Xu.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:44.990
I still have work to do.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.770
I'll treat you another day.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.480
Professor Xu,

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.400
Yi has a strong personality

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.260

Be patient.

Give her some time.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.980
You're exactly
how I imagined you would be—

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.440
intelligent,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.790

Come to my studio.

I think we're a good match.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.200
See you tomorrow.

Professor Xu,

you're here.

We meet again.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.200
Please, have a seat.

Alright, you sit here.

Okay.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000

No need.

You're a guest now.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.010
Don't be polite. Sit down.

Well...

sorry for troubling you.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.640
a capable leader,

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.090
can set the tone

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.270
for the whole series.

Let's just talk freely.

a Public-Private Partnership]

Everything you said is no different

from the central government's
guiding principles.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.590
Do you think

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.680
I should answer differently from them?

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.310
No.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:55.550
I just feel that

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.160
a competent leader like you

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.480
should have your own understanding
and interpretation.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.030
My understanding and interpretation

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.790
were all in my previous answer.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.190
Do you need me to repeat it?

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.800
No need.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.590
You know

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.070
I'm a fast note-taker.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.730
I'll review it later.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:15.270
Minister,

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:17.240
I heard

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.880
you have a principle

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.480
that as a leader,

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:21.750
one should be worldly

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:22.480
yet ascetic.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.960
This concept of "worldly yet ascetic,"

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.590
as I understand it, is a Puritan concept.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.640
Do you

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.510
believe in this philosophy?

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.110
This question
isn't on the interview outline.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.400
You don't have to answer it.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.200
It's alright.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.270
I can answer that.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.110
Communists aren't Puritans.

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.460
"Worldly yet ascetic" is just a metaphor.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.510
Not seeking personal gain
and serving the public with integrity

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.070
are what I demand of myself.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.310
I believe in communism.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.200
This stance

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.270
has never changed since the day

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.040
I joined the revolution.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.110
But can you truly

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.770
serve the public with integrity

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:02.750
and not seek personal gain?

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.590
This is something

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.270
every Communist

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.750
should do and must do.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:07.430
Good.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:13.920
Mr. Yang.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.700
Hello.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.260
Hello, Mr. Yang.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:17.930
Hello.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.300
Mr. Yang.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.260
How many times have I told you?

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.580
You've never worn your hat properly.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.690
Put it on straight.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.070
The hat itself is crooked.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.930
Fix it!

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.670
Try to straighten it as best you can!

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.310
Besides, as an electrician,

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.330
why are you sitting here doing nothing

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.460
instead of working?

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.070
Are you sleeping?

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.570
You've been transferred.
Why are you still bossing me around?

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:01.640
Let me tell you,

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:03.990
I can now

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.070
not only supervise you,

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.650
but also everyone else here.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.550
Understand?

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.350
Yes, Mr. Yang.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:13.570
Get to work.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.440
Hello, Mr. Yang.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.900
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Yang.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:29.800
Ms. Yi,

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.070
I don't sense any signs of cooking here.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:35.760
Are we going out to eat?

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.300
Here's some water.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:46.770
I asked you here today

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.720
because I have something to tell you.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.790
I also have so much I want to tell you.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.270
I wrote a poem

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.920
to express my feelings.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.370
Let me read it to you.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.610
A gentle breeze

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.440
blows softly.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.480
The whole world seems to stand still.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.540
Only the image of you in the photo

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.160
awakens the dawn of my heart.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.530
I hope you understand the love in my eyes.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.170
I'll wait in silence!

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.450
I'll wait in silence

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.450
for the moment our hearts connect.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.130
Are you done?

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.510
I don't know what Qing has told you.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:57.880
I don't like you.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.220
Why?

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.510
No reason. I just don't like you.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:08.830
Ms. Yi,

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.770
you don't need to hide your feelings.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.560
Yunqing told me everything.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.330
You and your husband were deeply in love.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:18.720
No one can replace him.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.970
I don't want to replace him,

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.270
and I won't disturb you.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.790
I only ask that you allow me

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.310
to stay

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.720
by your side,

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.370
waiting patiently

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.960
until you've healed.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.440
Thank you for your recognition.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.600
But your feelings came out of nowhere.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.330
I'm so confused.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.970
You've only known me for a few days.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:52.920
What do you like about me?

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.270
Do you even know me?

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.400
Well,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.280
you don't have to understand someone
to like them.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.550
Liking is an instinct.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.590
You're an artist—you understand.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.990
I'm sure you can feel the passion
of my love.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:13.850
I'm sure you can feel the passion
of my love!

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.160
I... I can feel it.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:23.640
But...

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.070
I don't like you.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.070
It has nothing to do with my husband.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:31.380
I simply don't like you.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.770
You like someone else?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.620
Yes.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.060
I don't believe it.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.850
That's impossible.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:55.700
No, no. I don't believe it.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:57.990
Professor Xu,

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.290
I respect you very much.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.350
And I hope

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.890
you respect me as well.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.400
I see.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.790
So I'm the third wheel.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.160
Ms. Yi,

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:15.880
I wish you

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.920
happiness

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.600
with the one you love.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:22.930
Thank you.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.310
Secretary Zhao, you're here.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.960
Please have a seat.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.680
Okay.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:49.960
Sit.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.850
-Where is the Scholar?
-I'll go get Minister Wen.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.790
Minister Wen.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.940
Coming.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.000
Secretary Zhao is here.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.400
Good. Thank you.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:29:59.480
You can go now.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:03.550
Here.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.460
Is this all you're giving me to eat?

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.520
What did you bring?

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:11.350
Take a look.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.590
Pig's head meat?

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.790
Mrs. San,

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.430
bring an empty plate.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.250
Look.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.370
I've prepared some homemade liquor.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.880
We won't drink yours.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.070
Today,

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.270
try mine.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.900
What's the occasion for such good liquor?

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.110
What?

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.180
Do we need a special occasion
to drink good liquor?

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:44.600
Today we're celebrating my

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.030
complete transformation.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:47.560
Complete transformation?

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.920
What kind of transformation?

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.000
Explain it to me.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:52.980
Here.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.720
Explain first.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.680
So, tell me,

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.880
what's the good news?

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.080
Scholar,

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.720
I've been thinking.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.750
Back then,

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:10.160
on the battlefield,

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.740
we survived bullets flying everywhere.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:15.730
We literally crawled out
from piles of the dead.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.080
Doesn't that count
as a complete transformation?

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.610
New China has been founded.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.690
We won the war,

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.610
and our lives have gotten better.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.280
We turned our lives around.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.570
Doesn't that count as a transformation?

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.530
I guess so.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:31.990
So,

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.310
let's celebrate.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:39.920
Mrs. San.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:42.670
Alright, you can go now.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:43.300
Okay.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:43.850
Alright.

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:55.160
Zhao.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.350
Here's how I see it:

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.310
you and I

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:02.770
are both ordinary people

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.560
from ordinary backgrounds.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:06.920
No matter

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.090
how much we change,

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.960
we won't become immortals.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.640
Right?

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.930
But since you moved to the city,

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.830
you've changed quite a bit.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.800
Your brand-name leather shoes

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.200
are so shiny.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.000
That shirt must be
at least 100-thread-count,

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.730
made of high-quality fabric.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.110
Sometimes

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.010
I even catch a hint of perfume on you.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.320
I'm not wearing any perfume today.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.320
Then when did you?

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.350
I've never worn perfume.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:34.630
Maybe I smelled wrong.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.740
Alright, alright.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.400
I'm here to have a drink.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.960
Don't keep lecturing me, okay?

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.220
I'm not lecturing you.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.070
What's wrong?

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.750
Now that life's better,

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:51.680
is it too much

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.070
if I enjoy

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:54.640
some good things?

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.040
Anyway, I'm telling you,

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.120
if anything happens,

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.310
you have to talk to me in time.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.000
We've survived through hell together.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.510
Whatever happens,

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.920
you must tell me,

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.000
okay?

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.770
Don't worry.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.060
We're brothers who have been through

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.120
life and death together.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.550
What couldn't I tell you?

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.000
No matter what happens,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.880
our bond will never change.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.030
Try mine.

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:30.750
I'm good with this homemade liquor.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:31.550
It's smooth.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.960
So smooth.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.010
Still tastes the same as back then.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:39.470
Fine, don't drink it then.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:43.160
You drink yours,

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.480
and I'll drink mine.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.770
I had an argument with Yang Xue'an today.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.160
Have you eaten, Qing?

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:04.590
Aren't you going to ask
why I argued with him?

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:05.720
I don't want to know.

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.610
Yang Xue'an said you were pursuing Wen…

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.050
Sun.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:15.889
It's fine.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:17.290
I'm just talking to Yi.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:21.920
Come in.

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:24.639
I...

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:28.320
Come in!

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:36.600
Yang Xue'an said
you were pursuing Minister Wen.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.440
I'm talking to you.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:41.570
Please tell Yang Xue'an

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.679
that if he's only saying this nonsense
to you,

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.170
I advise him to stop.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.230
If he's spreading rumors outside,

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.960
I'll sue him.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.840
Do as you like.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:50.960
I just want to ask you now:

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.810
do you have any

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.500
inappropriate relationship

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.800
with Minister Wen?

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.440
That has nothing to do
with you and Yang Xue'an.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:01.990
There you go again with that attitude.

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:03.650
How is it nothing to do with me?

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:04.720
I'm telling you,

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.970
you can be with whoever you want,

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.730
but you cannot be with Minister Wen.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:08.860
Who is Minister Wen?

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:09.990
A high-ranking leader,

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:11.050
a veteran revolutionary.

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:12.250
He's my direct superior,

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.850
my boss.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.280
What does it mean if you are with him?

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.230
Have you thought about me?

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:17.280
How am I supposed

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.340
to hold my head high at our workplace?

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.380
It's an honor to have you here,
Minister Wen.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.610
It's so lively and bustling here.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.930
The location you chose

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.130
for your welfare factory is excellent.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.890
Wen,

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.930
this land was specially approved
by the provincial committee.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:56.640
Is that so?

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.390
This place is mainly

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.030
for accommodating

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.370
wounded soldiers and their families.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.230
I plan to—

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:03.900
look—

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:05.630
grow some crops here,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.220
and maybe raise chickens

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.180
and pigs.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.440
Not bad.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:11.920
When you run a factory,

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:15.190
you should make use
of local agricultural resources.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.110
This place is quite far from the city.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.220
You need to consider medical care.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.400
What if someone falls ill…

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.130
I've been thinking about that.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.730
Medical equipment

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.360
and staff

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.000
will be coming in soon.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.860
See? We're thinking alike again.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.630
You really did improve.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:31.520
I improved?

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.070
Brother-in-law,

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.840
my car tire just got punctured.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.780
Can I borrow your new car?

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.380
Who are you calling brother-in-law?

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.400
Secretary Zhao,
my tire just got punctured.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.590
Let me use your new car.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.670
Leave us now!

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.880
Little brat.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.360
He must have mistaken me for someone else.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.480
Wen, take a rest.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.760
Well...

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.590
Liu,

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.330
get Minister Wen a glass of water.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:57.890
No.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.550
Make him some good tea.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.590
Take a break first.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.590
I'll handle this.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.690
Where did this brat even come from?

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.710
Working on Sunday?

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.150
You're working too.

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.560
Zhou said you two had a fight again.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:27.910
Thanks for your concern.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:30.440
Zhou and I fight all the time.

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:32.960
You can handle this once,
but not every single time.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.510
You're a martyr's widow

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.550
and our chief designer.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.030
Of course I care about you.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.280
Besides,

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.730
this is a task Minister Wen's assigned me.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.550
Mom.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:45.280
Mom.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.850
-Mom.
-Mom.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:48.150
Why are you here?

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.550
And you brought your little brother.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:51.660
Big Sister brought us here.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.870
Mom, I'm hungry.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.750
Miss, I'm hungry.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.590
Come on.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.040
Why don't you go to my place?

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.750
I'll make her some noodles.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:07.590
Okay.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:08.510
Thank you.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:12.690
You always cause trouble for me.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:14.480
Brother-in-law, stop it.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.540
Look. What's this?

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:17.760
Don't call me brother-in-law.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.030
Secretary Zhao, stop it.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.230
Look what I have here.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:24.360
You didn't come when you should have,

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.760
and now you're here
causing trouble for me.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.010
Give it to me.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.590
Secretary Zhao is not my brother-in-law!

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.630
My brother-in-law is not Secretary Zhao!

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:34.440
Shut up!

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.830
Get lost!

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:42.590
See you, Brother-in-law.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:48.960
Well...

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.070
What...

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:55.820
What kind of person is he?

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.900
My car tire got punctured.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.150
Brother-in-law?

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.980
He calls you brother-in-law?

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.960
Well...

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:06.850
He was just joking around with me.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.410
I don't remember Jiang
having such a brother.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:10.820
He's

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.250
a distant cousin of Jiang.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.850
He's lazy, refuses to study,

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:15.840
and has nothing to do,
so they sent him here to me.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.040
And now he's just making trouble for me.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.070
Really?

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.330
Why would I lie to you?

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:33.360
This is a nice car.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.460
A Mercedes, right?

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.350
I don't really know

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:38.300
what car this is.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.840
Whose car is this?

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.440
That brat said it's his relative's car.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.960
He drove it here for fun.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.880
His relative?

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.150
I know this car.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.710
You do?

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:58.320
Yes.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.190
The owner is Fu Zihe.

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.440
This is the only Mercedes in Shanghai.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.030
If he's related to Fu Zihe,

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.410
wouldn't that make you
Fu Zihe's relative too?

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:12.000
Well...

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.860
How could I possibly
be related to Fu Zihe?

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.800
Alright.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.720
You scout.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.430
I knew I couldn't hide anything from you.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.030
It's Fu Zihe's car.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.460
He let me drive it for a few days

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.000
just to have some fun.

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.630
Zhao, you're so stupid.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.150
You know very well

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.760
who Fu Zihe is.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.070
Driving his car?

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.960
Don't you understand

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.320
what that implies,

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:45.190
Zhao?

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.440
It's not that serious.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.000
My dear Scholar.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:51.660
Fu Zihe

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.770
is a capitalist.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.630
But don't you also socialize

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.080
with capitalists?

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.920
Did I ever say anything about that?

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.280
So it's okay when you do it,

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.880
but not when I do?

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.120
I keep my distance when I deal with them.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.980
I only talk business with them,

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.960
never private matters.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.760
And I never accept gifts.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.770
That's my principle.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.880
I just borrowed a car.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.090
What's the big deal?

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.440
Don't try to brush this off.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.320
This is serious.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.880
So what?

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.230
Are you going to arrest me?

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.590
Why don't you just have me executed?

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.190
I don't have that authority.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.760
Don't forget,

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.630
Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan
are a warning to us all.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.090
I never thought you'd compare me

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:35.570
to Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan.

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:37.970
Do you really think
I'm that kind of person?

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:39.230
Zhao,

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:40.960
many veteran revolutionaries

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.190
survived the war years

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.320
but have fallen now.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.400
You know this very well.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.000
-Alright, alright.
-Right?

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:47.400
I've been thinking,

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.200
why did we fight the revolution?

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:51.630
Was it just to replace
those corrupt officials,

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.230
only to be toppled by others in the end?

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:54.660
Stop lecturing me here.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:02.320
I'll return the car tomorrow,

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.000
okay?

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.720
I'll pump the tire,

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:05.820
fill the tank,

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.640
and then give it back to him.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:09.280
I'll do whatever you say.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.140
Is that enough?

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:13.590
You still

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.550
need to report it to the Party Committee.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:16.150
What?

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:17.590
Report it to the Party Committee?

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.140
Yes.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.200
I'm not going!

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.960
Why?

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:24.780
If you don't tell anyone,

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:25.910
who would ever know?

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.960
Who would know?

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.490
You drive around
in this stupid car every day.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:30.550
Do you think nobody's noticed?

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:31.630
That's your weak spot,

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:34.090
and anyone could use it against you
anytime.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.720
I'm still not going.

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.000
Let me tell you,

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.070
don't count on getting lucky.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.320
You've made mistakes before.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.450
Have you forgotten?

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.510
I'm still not going.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.280
You're not?

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.740
Fine.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:57.160
Where are you going?

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.440
Back to the city.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:59.840
Are you going to walk back?

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.480
Yes!

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:01.970
I'll drive you!

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.630
I'll drive you in my jeep!

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.060
I'm not getting in!

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:10.480
Stubborn fool!
