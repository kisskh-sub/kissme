00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.360
- Are you sure it is supposed to rain?
- Of course.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.720
When it comes to weather, trust me.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.180
I have a friend who works at the National Weather Service.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.650
He asks me about the weather, too,

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.770
because I'm more accurate than them.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.050
It would be awesome if I knew what the precipitation level would be.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.210
I mean, if the infected people barge in, we would get hurt first.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.150
Still, it doesn't make sense to go into someone else's house.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.360
Oh, excuse me.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.700
Give us a moment. Please hear us out.

[SY Home Cleaning]

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.990
Being on the second floor is dangerous. If they get past the lobby, our apartment is right there.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.470
So we would like to move to that unit.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.900
Please tell her it is okay to do that.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.110
Some guy threw away food waste on the first floor so it stinks too.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.930
I'm the Building Representative so you only need to speak to me.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.690
You're saying you want to move to the 11th floor, right?

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.560
But isn't the door locked?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.760
We cleaned up unit 1102 recently, too.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.740
The passcode 8888 hasn't changed yet.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.400
We will make the place spotless when we leave in three days.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.220
Are you against this, Building Representative?

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.420
It could cause some legal issues later.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.900
And the 11th floor is the Royal level.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.800
I feel uneasy about letting the cleaning people in.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.810
Would the residents be happy with that?

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.250
Then why don't you ask the people who could be affected by it?

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.260
There is an attorney in the apartment building, too.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.250
From a lawyer's perspective, I would like to say it wouldn't be possible.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.780
If you go into someone else's home without permission, that's trespassing.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.050
If two or more go in without permission, it's breaking and entering.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.630
It's not a case of "No punishment against will," so anyone can report them, not necessarily only the house owner.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.660
Well...

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.620
I feel so bad having to say this, but you two...

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.750
If you go up higher, we will be the ones on the lowest floor.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.100
It is not our job to protect your household!

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.840
Come on now, here you go with glaring at me again.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.730
Only two old people live in my apartment!

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.080
If young people would stay on lower floors and reassure us....

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.730
Is that so bad? Is it?

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.550
Look here!

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.410
Oh Joo Hyung, since you bothered to show up,

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.030
please say something if you have an opinion.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.680
I think it would be good if you would stay here, Ahjussi.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.190
If you stay here like a guard dog,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.690
the residents would feel more secure. It would be nice.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.230
- What the hell is he saying?
- Don't...

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.510
- What did you say?
- Please calm down.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.840
Don't.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.160
Please calm down and just clean. Just clean.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.970
Okay, it'll be three days maximum.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.830
Let's endure a little more.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.240
Everyone is struggling a lot. We can't give you special treatment.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.780
More than that, where should we toss our trash?

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.640
The stench seeps in, even if I put them in the emergency stairwell.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.100
By chance, you didn't throw it out the window, did you?

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.720
- Did someone do that?
- I hope you didn't.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.870
If you need more water, put containers on the rooftop.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.790
I told unit 401 already, but I heard it will rain tonight.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.020
Oh? How did you know that? Is the internet back up?

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.830
Oh, he's a human weather center.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.700
He could have made it to the Major League but couldn't make it because of his knee injury...

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.220
- Not as far as the Major League...
- Aigoo.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.230
That's too bad, Young Man.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.170
You should exercise your thighs regularly.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.790
Okay. I should, Sir.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.030
Come on and exercise.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.740
Oh.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.540
Excuse me. I have something to tell you.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.990
It's about my oppa.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.130
Oppa isn't here.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.620
Oh, yes? He's not here, right?

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.060
When you said you wanted to talk about your oppa, I got worried.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.880
Oppa contacted me.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.700
Through that, yesterday before the power shut off.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.910
He seemed okay.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.050
Oppa had a very strong immune system as a child. He didn't catch colds that easily either.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.930
Well, is it possible that he didn't get infected?

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.740
I can only hope.

See? I told you it would rain.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.150
Sleep more. I will rush over.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.170
No, I'm awake.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.330
We have to bring it down and flush the toilet. I feel uncomfortable.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.600
And we will take the containers back up. We don't know when it will rain again.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.150
When is it going to rain?

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.530
- It is raining right now.
- Satan...

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.390
Go away!

Gosh, that hyung is driving me crazy.

What is this?

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.770
He got religious all of a sudden.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.430
He prays before he goes to bed now.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.470
I wonder if he's praying properly.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.860
Let's go to the rooftop.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.240
Go away, Satan!

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.810
It's raining.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.420
Should I go outside and collect the rain?

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.600
Heavy metal content, micro dust, pollutant. I will never drink rainwater.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.250
I won't drink the bathtub water either.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.410
We can go out in three days anyway. What's wrong with you?

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.160
You never know.

Wait! Don't go! Talk to me.

Did you get hurt a lot?

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.930
Are you sure you're infected?

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.460
I'm not certain.

Don't you have water at home?

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.460
Why touch someone else's things without permission?

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.860
It's okay. The rainwater is free.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.360
Drink it if you want more.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.390
Hey. You can't drink that straight.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.700
It's okay. During tactical training, I even filled my tummy up with muddy water.

Well... Do you drink rainwater?

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.360
I purify it.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.910
I have water purification tablets. Come by whenever you need them.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.740
Tell your husband in advance, though.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.670
I'll go over to that guy's house. Don't ever go there alone.

Don't worry. He even purifies rainwater.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.960
Do you think he would have taken the drugs from the gym?

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.240
What should we eat for dinner?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.860
We just ate.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.760
I think about what to eat for tomorrow's breakfast while I'm eating lunch.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.360
That way, I can enjoy the food I'm eating in anticipation.

The building representative also says I should keep working if I want to keep getting a salary.

Why would they throw away a half-filled trash bag?

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:20.240
It must be someone with tons of trash bags.

We are here about throwing out the trash.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.070
You know that martial law was declared.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.390
He said there are tons of infected people out there.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.210
- And?
- Must we find out everything that is going on inside?

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.520
There might be more infected people inside.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.640
And if we find them? What will we do then?

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.650
Where will we lock them up? We are locked up, too.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.530
Hyun, we can get out in two days.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.700
Let's not dig around unnecessarily in the name of investigation.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.520
You never know. What if they bite more people, one at a time, and increase the number of infected people?

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.650
My wife... is very ill right now.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.150
She had a mammogram done.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.830
I think the cancer is back.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.210
The hospital contacted her.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.070
We thought she was in remission and started the business.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:42.020
Hyun, I have to get to my wife.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.640
You know well how much my wife suffered.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.030
Hyung Jung Gook is right.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.940
There isn't much we can do.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.490
Give me all of them.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:25.130
All right. Let's endure a bit more until the quarantine team shows up.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.530
Let's do that.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.050
I can't hold myself back.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:51.010
The treatment potential matter #13 that started the clinical trials is effective.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.190
How much?

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.560
Seventy-two percent of the infected that have entered the serious stage

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.780
have shown improvement as far as symptom onset cycle and frequency.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.920
How is your thirst?

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.840
I don't feel that thirsty. How is my family?

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.170
They're fine outside.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.010
Colonel, wait...

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:35.290
So did you always enjoy eating meat?

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.000
No.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.850
I was a vegetarian.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.650
You show a lot of improvement.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.830
Don't worry about your family and do your best to recover.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.570
Yoon Sae Bom's blood analysis isn't completed yet, right?

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.010
Yes.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:16.030
Proceed with Yoon Sae Bom's analysis in secret and report #13 potential matter to the higher-ups.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.120
We are still at the beginning of the clinical trials.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.750
We need a little bit more data.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.710
That's why I'm telling you what I said, because we need more data.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.410
Drop hints about how the clinical trials have ended, and we only have to finalize.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:33.440
[D-1]

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.540
Oh, no.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.610
What were you doing inside?

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.160
Pardon?

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.080
Oh... it's nothing. I was feeling stuffy, so...

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.130
I heard this was an empty unit.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.460
Let me go inside, too, then.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.190
- I also feel stuffy.
- Gosh, no...

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:54.400
I'm sorry. My brother is in there.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.980
Na Soo Min, you're in there, right? Are you all right?

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:18.570
It's okay, Oppa. Talk. They're from upstairs.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.920
Yes, I'm still here.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.040
You ate a lunch box at the first-floor underground entrance, right?

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.120
Did your sister give it to you?

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.220
No. That was from the doctor on the sixth floor.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.750
He knew...

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.710
that I was infected.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.260
Here.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.910
What did Oh Joo Hyung say to you?

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.690
He asked me to come into the building,

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.570
but I said no. Then he

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.970
asked me to think about it

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.270
and gave me the lunch box.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.050
Why did you say no?

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.000
I'm sure you wanted to come inside.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.070
I got scared.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.170
I was afraid that I might bite people.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.640
Even if the lockdown is lifted tomorrow, stay home.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.510
- Okay.
- Both, you and Na Soo Min.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.110
We will go outside, explain the situation, and bring back the medical staff.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.320
Thank you for understanding. Really.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.790
It's not that we're being understanding. We have no other choice.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.520
There's no place we can kick both of you out to.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.520
But still, I thank you.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.910
Thank you, both of you.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.430
Bo Ram.

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:36.960
Come here for a moment. Just a moment.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.850
- Bo Ram.
- I'm telling you ahead of time.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.900
I won't accept your money so don't worry.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.390
I don't want to get involved in this.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.720
No, that's not it.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.500
You heard the loud banging noise last night, right?

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.190
That's the noise that the infected people make.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:13.150
I think it's my mom. I saw the selfie that she took. She had a wound on her back.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:17.390
She said she bumped into an infected lady on the sixth floor before.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.440
And?

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.920
What do you mean, and? If my mom is infected, it means we could get infected, too.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.460
Are you scared?

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.230
Not worried?

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.380
If you're that scared, just lock your door and stay here.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:36.190
No, that's not what I mean. I'm worried about you.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:40.520
Worry about me? Be good to your parents.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.090
I would want nothing more if I had parents like them.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.680
Wait...

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:59.520
When the lockdown lifts tomorrow and the situation is settled, I will go see my mom first.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.820
Lieutenant Lee Ji Soo says they're protecting her.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.180
I'm sure she's fine.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.630
I had no idea I would see mom under these circumstances.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.010
The U.S. should be okay, right?

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.160
Thank goodness we didn't set a date for the wedding ceremony.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.120
I know. What if all this broke out while they were on their way?

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.760
I almost became a terrible son.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.700
We did the right thing, right?

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.050
Getting married? Of course, it's the right thing!

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.890
No, the fourth floor.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.420
Oh, Na Soo Min...

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.030
He didn't seem that bad. Is it because it's the beginning stage?

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:46.900
Colonel Han Tae Seok says thirst is controllable as long as the person is willing.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.750
Then I would never catch it.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.960
Since I have such tenacity.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.570
Makes me almost look forward to it.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.670
What's this? Something edible?

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.520
It's for digestion. When I used to play baseball, I used to get a stomachache if I tensed up.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.190
I bought it when I went to the Italian Championship, but it tastes nasty. Don't eat it.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.860
I have never taken any meds for indigestion.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.400
Wow, I'm so jealous.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:25.900
I can eat everything in here.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.030
- It's quite a lot, isn't it?
- It is.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.190
It's because we combined Seo Yoon's.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.700
All this even after we handed out everyone's share.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.910
After the lockdown is lifted tomorrow, let's put them all back.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.330
But what if the lockdown isn't lifted tomorrow?

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.310
We can wait while eating all that.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.240
Since you said you have tenacity.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.450
I'm so grateful.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.170
[D-Day]

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.590

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.580
[Out of service. Out of service area.]

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:57.600
Ahjussi, do you want to go outside, or do you want to stay here with Seo Yoon?

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.390
Well...

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.440
Someone should stay with Seo Yoon, right?

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.890
Then let me borrow your gun.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.790
Hey, Sae Bom.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.930
I'm struggling these days.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.340
All right. Keep it.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.640
I just asked. Just in case.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.880
Unni, I can't call her yet.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.070
She should be okay, right?

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.900
Of course. Stay home with Ahjussi.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.620
I will go out and check out the situation.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.730
If it looks like you'll get hurt, run away right away.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:41.170
Don't worry. I'm pretty quick in that department.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.620
Hello.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:54.350
What is this?

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.370
It was here when I got here.

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.580
[Thank you for your hard work until the end]

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.710
Wow... I had no idea someone so kind lived here.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.580
It must be someone with a lot of water at home.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.220
I think it's the young lady on the fourth floor.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.920
She seems compassionate.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:18.260
Did you live comfortably on the third floor? After almost killing all of us?

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.220
I'm sorry.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.150
Wow!

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:31.310
What's all this? It's like an oasis in a desert. Daebak.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.930
Did you prepare this, Building Rep?

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.820
You all went through so much.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.900
Wow! I can drink a few, right?

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.450
Sure, sure. Go ahead.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.410
Here you go.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.480
Here. Take it. We are neighbors.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.430
But when will they let us out?

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.060
Let's go outside and check.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.190
Who wants to go with me?

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:25.860
Let's go.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.030
We won't know unless we go outside.

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.320
Hey, don't drink that.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.830
Who knows if someone put something in it?

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.490
No way.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.980
Hey!

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.960
Hey.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.580
Did we come out too early?

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.500
This is a real situation.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.630
People of South Korea, this is a real situation.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:47.120
The martial law that was to be lifted today

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.580
will be extended indefinitely.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.990
I'll repeat.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.880
The martial law that was to be lifted today

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.130
- will be extended indefinitely.
- Oh, my God!

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:59.980
- Why?
- Oh, my God!

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.560
This is a real situation.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.870
Oh, my gosh!

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.530
I'll repeat.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:09.180
People of South Korea, this is a real situation.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.090
The martial law that was to be lifted today

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:16.200
will be extended indefinitely.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.690
I'll repeat.

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.160
This is a real situation.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.950
People of South Korea, this is a real situation.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:42.720
Woo Sang Hee said she needed some legal advice so for a moment...

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.860
Where is she?

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.190
She was here. Where did she go...

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:49.920
Over there. There she is.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.440
You came.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.190
I'm losing a lot of money since I'm trapped in here. I wanted to get an estimate.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:05.590
- You heard the announcement, right?
- Yes, we were both so shocked.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.610
- Right?
- Yes.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.040
- You're done with the consultation, right?
- Yes, right.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.880
Go then.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.420
Okay.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.270
If you need anything else, I'll advise you in legal matters whenever...

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.200
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.850
Hey, don't drink that!

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.280
You're the one who put them downstairs, saying you wanted to get along with everyone.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.820
But we can't leave anymore.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.400
Was it good?

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.920
- What was?
- The lawyer across the hallway.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.180
The legal consultation.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.800
It was so-so.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.740
Where did you go? You said you were staying home.

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.090
Oh, just across the hallway.

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:26.130
I gave consultation to Sang Hee since the martial law was lifting,

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:29.330
but I heard the martial law isn't lifting. Geez.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.200
I don't even get paid for the consultation. I shouldn't have done that.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.260
What do we do now?

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:45.860
Excuse me. Let's just try going outside.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.590
We can't just stay here like this.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.140
They're extending the martial law.

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:53.630
What if we go outside? We can get shot right away!

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:57.970
The loud banging noise we heard earlier...

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.620
It could be coming from the outside or the basement levels.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.480
My mom.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.430
I'm suspicious of my mom.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.820
My mom has a wound on her back!

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.190
I saw a picture she took of her back with her cell phone.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.470
You're telling the truth, right?

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:19.020
Dad! You know Mom is acting weird, right?

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.620
Geez! It's psoriasis!

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:29.160
When you get old, your skin dries out. It's a wound she got from scratching!

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:33.730
I put on her back... what do you call it...

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.680
Geez, you know that thing! Like this...

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.960
- Moisturizer?
- That's right! Moisturizer!

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.070
I put on moisturizer on her!

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:46.940
I saw it, too. It's just dry skin.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.220
Let us go and confirm.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.880
Let's hear them out.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.090
Who says you can come into our unit?

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.730
Do whatever you want to do out here.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:00.390
My wife and I won't come out of our apartment anymore!

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.590
How wretched!

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.750
We need to discuss daily necessity items.

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:17.000
We should pass out food and essential items on the second floor to each household.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.770
What the hell are you talking about? What are we supposed to eat?

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.110
Are you telling us to starve to death?

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:25.790
Actually, they don't even belong to you anyway.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.330
To be honest, you just happened to bring them inside.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:32.010
- Ahjumma! Are you serious right now?
- Look here.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.160
We put our lives on the line to bring them here.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.250
Who are you to hand them out?

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.320
You live here for free.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.450
Why are you getting angry at me?

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:43.990
Wow, before you were bulls***ting saying the 11th is the royal level.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:46.930
Why not just ask for the cost of the air I breathe? Do you want me to pay for it?

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:50.470
This is how you betray my consideration.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.090
- Consideration?
- Now, now, now...

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.670
Everyone, calm down. Please calm down.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.530
- You should have gone out there that day, Ahjumma!
- Please calm down.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:59.360
We brought them here, putting our lives on the line!

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.770
- The Building Rep...
- We put our lives on the line!

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:03.350
We can't let her keep being like this.

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:05.270
If we don't do anything, they'll just end up fighting, right?

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:08.750
- How can you say that?
- Sister, please calm down.

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.540
Miss.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:23.250
You shouldn't stay here any longer.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.830
Go somewhere else.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.490
I have nowhere to go.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.920
Go to the married couple at unit 501. They're good children.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.180
I'm sure they'll find you a place to sleep.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.160
Bye now.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.660
Honey, why did they call us?

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:51.370
You know. All the same things they talk about every day!

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:53.220
You...

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.260
Just set the table. I'm hungry.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.140
- Where's Dong Hyun?
- That punk...

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.230
I'm sure he's somewhere in the building.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:09.610
You know, the supermarket lady...

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.440
- There's an empty place available. She'll sleep there.
- I see.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.460
That's good!

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:29.510
I thought I would be taking the elevator starting today.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:35.400
Those cleaning people are no good. They have no manners.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.180
But it's not like you can kick them out.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:47.030
Oh, the door! Ouch!

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:48.900
My arm, my arm, my arm! Ouch!

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.160
My arm!

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:54.330
What is it?

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:57.760
I have something to discuss with you.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:02.860
- Let's talk outside.
- Thank you.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.330
- Hey, look!
- What?

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:10.120
We are already inside.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.860
Let's talk comfortably inside.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.850
Hurry up, hurry.

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.520
We haven't cleaned up yet.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.990
Are you sure you moved in here to live here?

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:30.830
We ordered the furniture and appliances as a set, but they haven't arrived yet.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:34.590
The fridge and the microwave are very simple.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.730
We still have to live somehow.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:41.730
Is it not that you didn't want to live here?

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.460
This is yours, right?

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.330
[Mooil Group Construction, Bid Selection Celebration]

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.230
- No.
- Well...

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:52.830
Do you see where it says "Mooil Group Construction, Bid Selection Celebration"?

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:56.100
They passed it out when they decided on the construction company for this apartment.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:01.500
Everyone who got to purchase the apartment unit has one.

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:06.560
For people who were picked for general sales. Not for people who got the cups for free.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.540
I know you gave water to Kim Seung Beom.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.810
Who told you that?

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:17.440
Your job is to become a resident representative and spend public funds and embezzle the profit, right?

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.560
Kim Seung Beom came in to help you with that, too.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.130
Do you have proof?

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:31.290
Let's go.

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:35.490
Ahjumma, I'll promise you one thing.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:38.330
You'll never...

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:40.760
become the resident representative.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:50.450
New and advanced investigative techniques. That was pretty good today.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:54.470
See that? You have to ask directly. If you don't, they'll just pretend like they don't know.

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:56.630
True.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.520
- Ahjussi.
- Did you come here to pray, too?

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.550
- I don't have a religion.
- I see.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:04.930
Where is Seo Yoon?

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:09.060
Bo Ram from the supermarket came up for a second so I asked her to stay with her.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.100
She left the third-floor house. She has no place to stay.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.690
- Then right now...
- Hurry back.

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:15.200
Oh, okay. I'll be right there.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.930
- Okay.
- Wait...

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:19.060
We will wait for you at home!

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:24.430
What do we do about Bo Ram? Should we tell her to go to unit 502?

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.070
Let me ask Seo Yoon.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.370
It's obvious it's a cult. I'm worried.

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:31.500
Hyung needs to be comforted, too.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.330
I was like that when I couldn't play baseball.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:34.960
Did you pray, too?

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.340
No, something else.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.030
Do you have beverages? Ones in plastic bottles.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.410
Not the ones with high calories.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.390
Give me 50,000 won ($50) worth.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:52.230
This guy still hasn't come to his senses yet.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.860
Why I ought to... Leave.

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.360
Wait. Geez, why...

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.760
100,000 won ($100).

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.960
Will you still not sell it to me?

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.570
200,000 won ($200) for a 500 ml bottle.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.790
Are you trying to change your life by selling these when you're not even residents here?

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:15.650
Why not?

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.800
Can't I change my life? I will make money and live here, too.

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:22.960
You called me a guard dog.

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:27.760
Bring me money. Don't want to?

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:35.140
I understand. I will just bring more money. Aish.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:43.640
That jerk. I barked, and he ran away scared. Did you see that?

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:50.470
What? Did I do something wrong?

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:52.500
That jerk looked down on me first.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.030
No.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:58.330
People don't carry cash these days. Let's accept jewelry, too.

00:42:58.330 --> 00:42:59.830
Oh, right.

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:02.830
That building representative. She looks like she would have some jewelry, right?

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.730
I'll make sure she gives me that.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:10.400
Now that it's come to this, I'll do everything I can to make money.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.230
We have to send Seung Hee to college, too.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.580
Ahjumma. Hey.

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:22.230
Don't clean up like the building representative tells you to.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:24.300
Just clean up here. Okay?

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:28.230
We are giving you expensive bread and water. Be grateful.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:39.000
Let the unjust do what is unjust.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.960
Let the dirty ones do what is dirty.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.530
Let the righteous ones do what is righteous.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:50.080
Let the holy ones...

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.830
My arm, my arm, my arm...

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.270
do what is holy.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:57.790
Amen.

00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.510
Say amen.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.360
- Amen.
- Amen.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:07.060
Do you know Yoon Sae Bom?

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.600
- Is she sick or anything?
- Pardon?

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.540
She has a wound on her hand.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.470
I was wondering if she's infected.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:20.830
And it seemed like there was something going on with that soldier ahjussi who came by.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:23.870
Am I right?

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:42.030
I have the flare...

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:44.840
You have a lot of stuff.

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.420
I have handcuffs.

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.190
And...

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.690
What's that? A walkie-talkie?

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:00.430
She said she can't give me a gun. She said I should take this instead.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.260
How do you turn it on? Hurry up and turn it on.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.950
I want to know what's going on outside.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.370
Hi, Seo Yoon. Eat some snacks.

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:12.940
Okay.

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:20.000
Later. If Hyung Jong Gook sees this, he'll feel unsettled again.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.330
Did you have a good pray session?

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:26.960
Yes. Oh, yes.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:37.460
Are you very worried because you can't go out?

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.570
No. That's not it.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:43.070
Do you know how you went out with Han Tae Seok last time?

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:44.860
You had blood on you.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:46.820
Are you all right?

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.330
Did you get hurt?

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:50.890
No.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:55.450
This... When did you get this?

00:45:55.450 --> 00:46:02.120
Oh, a friend scratched me a little while ago.

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.420
When you went to the dorm?

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:08.110
Hasn't that been a while, then?

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:10.410
It's not healing well.

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:15.190
Ahjussi, don't worry too much.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:18.380
If something happens, I'll tell you first.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.580
There's no way I would bite you or Hyun!

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.760
Okay.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.280
One, two, three,

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.590
four, five, six, seven.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.390
What was this?

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:42.180
[D+1]

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.750
What's wrong with you? Did you wake up at this hour?

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:29.550
Sir, please let me live here. My mom is infected.

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:31.720
Why would I trust you?

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.270
Go somewhere else.

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:35.250
I'm really okay. Please?

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:39.590
I was out all day. And look.

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.060
I'm really fine.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.290
I'll clean and do laundry here. I'll do everything.

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:48.490
And food. I brought all the food with me.

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:53.030
You and your wife are good people. I know you're truly compassionate.

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:55.200
Please help me.

00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:59.280
- Wait.
- Okay.

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:03.510
The more food we have, the better off we are.

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:06.720
We don't know how long we have to stay here.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:11.540
Where would we have him sleep? There's no room. What if he sleeps next to me and then attacks me at night?

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.910
I'll leave.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.630
Where would you go?

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:22.050
I'll try the fourth floor for now.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:24.670
If that doesn't work, I'll try another apartment.

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:31.540
In return, share a little bit of food with me.

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:55.830
Hey, Ahjumma.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:03.090
Will you be okay? Other people might not accept you in.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.470
Worst case, I'll go to the underground break room.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:10.030
I think I'll feel at peace staying there alone.

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.750
Please be careful.

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:15.670
People are becoming meaner.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.880
Thank you.

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:45.820
What now?

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:50.790
I found something. Something you'll be...

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:53.170
very happy to know.

00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:59.770
What did you find here?

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:04.340
Something you absolutely need right now, Building Rep. What's the passcode?

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.620
8888.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.570
See how well things turn out when we help each other?

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:17.860
What's inside?

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:20.300
You don't even know the passcode, yet you know what's there?

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:24.050
I saw someone put something away in here in secret.

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:26.610
The people from the second floor?

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:29.010
Did they hide food in here?

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:31.320
You'll be shocked when you see. Come.

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.230
Did you eat anything?

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:55.310
Who is in there?

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:58.340
I said you can't live in here!

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.220
Ahjussi, who are you?

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.540
Look at me.

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:22.110
Can anyone hear me out there?

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:24.540
Lieutenant Lee Ji Soo.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.140
Hey, Han Tae Seok!

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:31.100
I'm sure they didn't give up on us.

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:34.610
They must need some time to take care of the situation.

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:40.680
Okay. I don't want to kill the battery. Let's try again later.

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:46.490
- Hey.
- What?

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:51.280
Since we are up here, tell me about when you used to play baseball.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.210
When I won the championship?

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:57.310
- I stood on the mound as a relief pitcher in the third inning...
- Not that. Your story.

00:51:57.310 --> 00:52:00.180
Where did you find comfort instead of religion?

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:04.640
You said everyone needs comforting.

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:13.570
You.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.120
What?

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:20.920
To be honest, I felt so hopeless back then.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.300
In front of you, I pretended not to be,

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.670
but what am I if I can't play baseball?

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:27.890
I was nothing.

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:32.320
But after I heard what you said and fell down,

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:36.620
I thought, "Am I just going to die like this?"

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:40.630
Then my head cleared all of a sudden.

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:45.820
It wasn't such a big deal after all.

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.280
Thanks to you, I felt at peace.

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:54.560
You're embarrassing me. How can you say that to my face?

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.550
If you're grateful, you should just repay without me knowing.

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:01.010
I was always grateful to you.

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:32.310
You two are hanging around together. What's going on?

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:33.810
What do you care...

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:38.840
Na Soo Min has been hiding in the building while infected.

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.870
Is it true that you two hid him?

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.590
Can I come inside for a minute?

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.190
Na Soo Min!

00:53:58.190 --> 00:54:00.940
Can you hear what we are saying?

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:07.410
Since we can't hear him, I don't think he's having an episode.

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:44.040
Na Soo Min, are you okay?

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:53.790
Please save me.

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:58.850
I... I really didn't... I really didn't bite anyone.

00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:01.340
That building representative. I just looked at her.

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.670
I'm telling the truth.

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:08.280
I have to see my children.

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.530
You have to quarantine infected patients, right?

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.850
Please endure it. We'll be back after figuring out what's going on.

00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:27.000
Please make sure Hyun Kyung doesn't turn like me.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.860
Please be sure to protect her.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:33.690
I didn't make the banging noise.

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.800
It's not too late.

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:57.400
You two came in contact with the siblings. You could be suspected of being infected.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.510
From what I heard, you had come in contact with one of the first people who got infected.

00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:02.190
Even now, we should trust each other–

00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:06.380
Do you want us to support you to become the resident representative?

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:11.700
Are you sure this is the time to discuss that?

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:14.270
Then when is a good time for it?

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:17.700
There is no right time when it comes to making money.

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:26.720
You know that Oh Joo Hyung is a crazy bastard, right?

00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:33.620
Look what softies you are. How could you go up against Oh Joo Hyung?

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:44.160
Oh Joo Hyung is home, right?

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:48.040
Please step outside for a moment. It's going to get ugly.

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:57.160
I heard you found Na Soo Min.

00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:01.130
I did go out of my way for the safety of our apartment building.

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:10.500
Why don't have some?

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.820
I heard the infected people feel even more thirsty when they drink water.

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:18.320
You were constantly with Na Soo Min. I'm worried.

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:22.350
Are you looking for infected among us?

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:28.210
Then you should drink one, too, Ahjussi.

00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:33.840
Okay.

00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:21.920
What a relief.

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:24.930
All three of us are healthy.

00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:27.210
You must step up, Detective.

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:30.900
To prevent unforeseeable damage, that's the only way.

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.880
You want to be healthy when you meet your family again.

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.730
To do that, you must do

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:40.300
things you don't want to do.

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:44.440
There's something you can do. Why are you trying to avoid it?

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:51.610
What... What is it that I can do?

00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:54.450
Lock up the infected that pretends to be human.

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:57.720
And establish order.

00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:29.300
I think that bastard is throwing up.

00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:31.960
Should we, too?

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:35.410
Gosh, it was a little bitter.

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.110
Hey, I've never vomited on purpose. How do you do it?

00:59:38.110 --> 00:59:40.530
Just stay put.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:54.200
Min Ji turned like that after taking some kind of drug, right?

00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:01.620
The drug that her trainer was selling in secret.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.070
Did you put these in the drinks?

01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:07.770
You left the beverages in the gym, too, right?

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.050
So that everyone in the apartment will get infected.

01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:15.440
If all the residents died or got infected, you could be cleared of the murder charge.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.260
How can you come up with such a crazy idea?

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.340
That's not it.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:24.510
Only you two have to die. The rest of them are bonuses.

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:28.080
There have to be lots of infected for the treatment to be developed fast.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.640
I'm really speechless.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.090
You're making your confession right now, right?

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:36.630
So just go home and don't come out ever again.

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:41.060
If people accuse you of catching the Madman Rabies and croak, you're the ones losing out.

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:47.820
Until the cure is developed, just hide out in your apartment and live as if you're dead. Okay?

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:50.190
You killed Park Min Ji, too, right?

01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:54.510
No. I didn't kill anyone.

01:00:54.510 --> 01:01:00.160
If you two don't want to kill anyone, shut your mouth and stay put in your apartment.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.600
If you don't want to, leave the apartment building and ask that colonel or whatever for some help.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.040
But what are we going to do?

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.730
This is...

01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:17.310
What are you doing?

01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:20.040
What are you doing?

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:26.210
Hey! You don't know what that is! Spit it out! Hurry!

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:28.020
It's bitter.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:31.680
This is an indigestion medication I used to take when I played baseball.

01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:35.630
What's this? Is it food?

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:39.270
For digestion. When I used to play baseball, I used to get a stomachache if I tensed up.

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:44.280
Something kept bothering me about you, so I switched them.

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:19.970
You!

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:25.840
The black box captured you taking out the drug, too.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:31.590
Oh Joo Hyung, you'll never get out of this one.

01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:34.070
So what will you do?

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:36.440
What else?

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:39.020
We have to quarantine a murderer, too.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.280
Sae Bom.

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:58.490
I'm really sorry, but I can't get infected.

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:03.860
Ahjussi, Oh Joo Hyung killed a person.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.410
That has nothing to do with us.

01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:10.000
What's important right now is whether someone is infected or not.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.360
I heard you two came in contact with the infected.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:18.800
Yoon Sae Bom, you got a scratch from an infected person. You two should be quarantined.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:36.440
We can recover quickly with this valuable shot.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.360
Of course, we should.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.840
That will happen going forward?

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.090
Hurry and give me the shot.

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:45.680
Aigoo.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:53.470
There were many more infected than I thought.

01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:56.700
Did you all take NEXT?

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.180
I feel much better with this shot.

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.880
Good job. You should hurry up and give it to your wife, too.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.980
I should.

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.400
I heard manufacturing #13 potential matter is pretty difficult.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.160
Yes. We can't produce much of it.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.890
I think it will be good to maintain martial law for now.

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:20.360
We should distribute the drug after decreasing the number of infected by prolonging the quarantine.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:25.480
Those morons who might have killed people, if you keep them alive, there may be more issues in the future.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.800
You're absolutely right.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:34.120
Whether the situation is resolved or not, it's better to get rid of problematic people quickly.

01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:37.490
Just like all of you.

01:04:38.590 --> 01:04:40.180
What the hell are you talking about?

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:45.680
Didn't you sneak out the potential cure that just began clinical trials using your power and money?

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.720
You should be accountable for your wrongdoing.

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:54.360
So what do you plan to do?

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:38.900
Thanks to all of you, it will help me greatly in data gathering.

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:56.240
Have a wonderful time.

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:33.910
Colonel, there has been a problem at the Chairman's ward.

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:36.520
A group of high-ranking politicians was infected.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:42.030
#13 potential matter. They snuck it out and injected themselves.

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:45.510
That one failed at the second clinical trials.

01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:47.760
The entire line is currently being discarded.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.940
I guess they didn't know.

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:54.500
They're high-ranking officials. Tell them not to kill them but capture them alive.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.650
We can bring them in and use them for clinical trials.

01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.580
Honey...

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.360
I'm thirsty.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.210
Young In.

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.530
We're almost there.

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:53.250
♫ Take me, I'm exhausted ♫

01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:57.280
[Happiness]

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:01.280
♫ Hold on to me, I'm stained in red ♫

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.140

Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Happy Pandemic Team @ Viki.com

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:18.800
I'm almost at the end of my rope.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.470
Are you thirsty, too?

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:24.050
They hide their thirst well, and it's impossible to tell the difference just by looking.

01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:28.890
Be careful. You shouldn't trust those people.

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:31.460
Should I look for infected people?

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:36.520
All you have to say is you think the woman on the fifth floor is infected.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.950
If it becomes dangerous, I'll take the drug, too.

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:41.330
There will be casualties, for sure.

01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:42.420
I only have one choice.

01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:45.290
You guys killed him.
