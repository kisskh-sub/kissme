(Ledger)

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:18.799
The ledger looks fine.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.399
Mr. Jiang, shouldn't this ledger

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.240
be shown to Second Master?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.000
Did you forget who the family head is?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.200
Yes, of course.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.680
Why did you come in without knocking?

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.959
No need to be nervous, Mr. Jiang.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.880
I mean no harm.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.800
I just want to discuss a deal.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.318
The fact that I didn't call for help

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.038
already shows I'm letting you off easy.

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.078
As for a deal,

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.598
I have nothing to say to you.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.199
Leave the Pei residence!

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:06.679
Jiang Yao.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.840
Let's not beat around the bush.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.679
You were involved in those shady deals

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.719
my brother ran before.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.440
So who are you trying
to fool with this act of innocence?

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.159
Now that I'm wanted,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.640
I just want you
to help me leave Hu City.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.400
In return,

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.239
I can do something for you.

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.359
If you change your mind,

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.558
you know where to find me.

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:34.780

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.119
After we found my father's remains
at the warehouse,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.240
we buried him next to my mother's grave.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.720
Later, when you fell unconscious,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.720
I kept praying to my parents.

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.598
I asked them to bless you

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.798
and help you

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.239
pull through.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.320
Looks like your parents really like me.

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.039
They made sure I woke up.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.319
You brag whenever you get the chance.

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:26.679
Your parents need not worry.

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.719
I'll take good care of you.

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.159
I've asked Wen Yuan
to investigate who was

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.479
at the Pei residence
the day I was poisoned.

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.439
We should get a lead soon.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.320
Alright.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:40.719
One more thing.

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:44.199
Jiang Yao asked
to meet me this afternoon.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.640
Are you reporting to me?

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.439
What if you start coughing blood again?

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.320
Don't take too long.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.519
Xinruo, do you
still remember this place?

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.999
I used to eat strawberry cake
alone every time.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.760
You weren't upset, were you?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.839
Alright then,
I won't let you have it this time.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.239
No way!

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.719
Jiang Yao, it's over between us.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.280
But I can't let go.

00:04:28.359 --> 00:04:29.759
I can't lie to myself.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.919
Whether it was five years ago or today,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.400
my feelings for you have never changed.

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.558
I know Pei Yuze saved your life,

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:37.759
and you're grateful.

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:39.318
But you can't throw away your happiness

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.038
just to repay him.

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.119
Jiang Yao,
it's impossible between us now.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:46.639
Besides, you're already
engaged to Xueshan.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.838
You should devote yourself to her.

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:50.559
Don't let her down.

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:53.679
If it's because of her
that you're holding back,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.639
don't worry.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.959
I have no romantic feelings
for Xueshan at all.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.079
But she just lost her father

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.199
and has no one else.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.439
I can't ask her for a divorce right now.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.038
I'll leave her in good time.

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.879
Jiang Yao, I truly love Yuze.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.000
I really want to be with him.

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.959
This is the last time
I'll explain it to you.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.960
From now on,
I won't meet you alone again.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.400
Xinruo...

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.860
(Pei Residence)

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.598
I thought after the Master died,

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.358
Second Master would take over as head.

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:33.118
Who knew it would be Mr. Jiang instead?

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:36.038
Though the master
groomed him as his successor,

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.758
he's still an outsider by blood.

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.598
Can he really put
the Pei family above all else?

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.399
Second Master may be weak in health,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.518
but if he and Miss Lian had a child now,

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:45.838
the family head position
would still pass down to him.

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:46.879
Exactly.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.879
Master.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.318
Dr. Fang, what brings you here?

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:51.439
Is Xueshan not feeling well?

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.078
Miss Xueshan caught a chill.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:54.999
It might affect
tomorrow's Mid-Autumn banquet.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.399
So they asked me to check on her.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.000
Oh, Dr. Fang.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.558
Second Uncle just got discharged.

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.959
If you have time,
you should also check on him.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.280
Second Uncle?

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.960
Dr. Fang, what's wrong?

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:07.999
Why don't you just say it?

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.639
There's something
I'm not sure if I should mention.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.680
When Second Master
was hospitalized after being shot,

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.838
I happened to see his medical report.

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:17.838
It looked like his body
was perfectly fine.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.039
Fine?

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:21.279
Everyone says he won't live past thirty.

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.199
But from that report,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.598
his health seemed
no different from an ordinary man's.

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.439
There were no signs
of a serious illness.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.199
Are you saying Pei Yuze
has been faking it?

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.758
Not exactly. He really did
fall ill when he was younger.

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.278
I was the one who treated him.

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:36.479
I can't be mistaken.

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:39.558
Maybe while he was overseas,
he found a good doctor

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:41.078
and has already recovered.

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:42.439
That'd be a blessing.

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:47.399
Master, I still have patients waiting.
I'll take my leave.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.140
(Longevity with Grace)

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.920
Faking illness?

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.660
(Blessed by Heaven and Earth)

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.120
Xueshan?

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:05.799
What's the matter?

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:06.838
No...

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:07.919
It's nothing.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.840
What happened?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.920
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival today.

00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:20.039
Every year on this day,

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:21.999
no matter how busy Father was,

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:25.399
he'd always come home to have
dinner with me and watch the moon.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.600
But now,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.000
I don't have any family left

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.480
on this day of reunion.

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:37.119
Xinruo...

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.000
I know I shouldn't blame or hate you.

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:42.719
But he was still my father.

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:45.359
My grief is too much to bear.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.078
These grudges had
nothing to do with you.

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:50.558
It's natural you'd feel this way.

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:53.519
From now on, you don't have to hide it.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.840
Xinruo.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.040
I know Yao has always loved you.

00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:01.679
If you still care about him,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.039
I'm willing to step aside
and let you two be together.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.479
Jiang Yao and I
were over a long time ago.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.759
That's all in the past.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.038
I won't dwell on it.

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:10.358
If you truly love him,

00:08:10.359 --> 00:08:12.079
then be with him wholeheartedly.

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:34.599
Second Master,
should I serve the mooncakes now

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.638
or wait until we enjoy
the moon in the garden?

00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:38.198
Wait until we're outside.

00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:39.119
Yes, sir.

00:08:41.199 --> 00:08:42.879
And the gifts from each household?

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.638
Should I hand them out to the stewards?

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:46.238
Pick out some treats for the children

00:08:46.239 --> 00:08:47.879
and send them
to the orphanage in Hu City.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.080
Yes, sir.

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:55.479
Yao, eat up.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.119
Are you full?

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:02.278
Then, let's take a walk outside.

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:03.239
Alright.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.119
Yao, you're the family head now,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.040
yet they only listen to Second Uncle.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.040
Yao?

00:09:25.719 --> 00:09:26.679
Yao!

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.540
(Spider Dispels Wind and Poison)

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.519
What are you doing?

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.559
You look serious.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.439
The remedies we tried
these past few days barely worked.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.678
So I'm wondering which one

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:48.079
we should try tomorrow.

00:09:57.359 --> 00:09:58.559
Stop it.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.760
It's useless.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.240
You think I don't know anything?

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.879
Tell me.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.000
What should I do?

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.519
Do nothing?

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.520
Just watch you die before my eyes?

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:25.319
I can't do it.

00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:30.079
I feel like the most useless person.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.360
You really don't need to do all this.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.560
As long as you're with me,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.800
that is

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.360
the greatest comfort I'll ever need.

00:10:52.239 --> 00:10:53.319
Besides,

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.238
I'm not exactly

00:10:55.239 --> 00:10:58.039
a sickly man with one foot in the grave.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.160
If we really sparred,

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:03.199
you might not even be my match.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.238
I don't care.

00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:06.799
You're such a big head.

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:08.879
You don't believe me?

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.400
Try me.

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:24.119
Pei Yuze, stop messing around.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.160
You always...

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.120
I'm not messing around.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.359
Pei Yuze.

00:11:33.719 --> 00:11:34.559
You...

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.480
You...

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.200
What's wrong this time?

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:38.439
Pei Yuze?

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.960
I'm not feeling well.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.638
Put me down.

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:44.079
You tricked me again.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.120
Put me down!

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.439
Yao, you've had enough.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.760
It's bad for your health.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.999
Leave me alone.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.080
Get out.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.400
Yao.

00:12:06.799 --> 00:12:08.599
Please take good care of yourself.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.200
(Do you want to know)

00:12:26.319 --> 00:12:28.679
(if Xinruo truly has me in her heart?)

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.360
I told you,

00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:32.879
you can't beat me.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.838
Jiang Yao.

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:35.678
It's over between us.

00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:38.399
(Though the master
groomed him as his successor,)

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.119
he's still an outsider by blood.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.959
Can he really put
the Pei family above all else?

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.678
(Maybe while he was overseas,
he found a good doctor)

00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:45.919
and has already recovered.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.678
Jiang Yao, I truly love Yuze.

00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:49.599
I really want to be with him.

00:12:50.199 --> 00:12:51.919
Yao, you're the family head now,

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.720
yet they only listen to Second Uncle.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.480
I worked so hard to climb my way up

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.080
from a secretary's son to this.

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:06.599
I worked so hard
to bring down Pei Yujie.

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:09.198
Why are you fighting me for it?

00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:11.079
You have no right!

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.400
I will be the family head.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.960
Xinruo will be mine!

00:13:29.359 --> 00:13:30.640
Yuze.

00:13:30.719 --> 00:13:32.039
It's so hot.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.320
I want some ice.

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:45.959
Jiang Yao.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.758
Why are you here? Where's Yuze?

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:51.358
Pei Yuze is no match for me now.

00:13:51.359 --> 00:13:53.359
I'm the family head now.

00:13:54.319 --> 00:13:56.039
The Pei family is mine.

00:13:56.359 --> 00:13:58.399
And you're mine too.

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:01.519
Are you out of your mind?
I'm your Second Aunt now.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.119
You're the one who needs to wake up.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.439
We used to love each other so much.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.758
Did you forget all of it?

00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:08.639
Besides, that sickly Pei Yuze
is about to die.

00:14:08.719 --> 00:14:10.639
I'm your only choice.

00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:12.479
Oh, really?

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:27.358
Jiang Yao, as long as I'm here,

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:29.239
neither the head position nor Xinruo

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.400
will ever belong to you.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.960
Pei Yuze, I'll kill you!

00:14:36.719 --> 00:14:37.719
Xinruo!

00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:48.119
You...

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.638
Do you have no shame?

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.319
This is called a sound tactic.

00:14:55.319 --> 00:14:56.999
This is called turning the tables.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.000
Fine, I admit defeat. Happy?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.640
How about we keep competing?

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:14.839
Compete in what?

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.160
Let's see

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.360
which of us

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.319
calls stop first.
