00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.230
Sae Bom is here, right?

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.580
She is a little busy right now.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.150
She will be out soon. Please wait.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.970
Did you take the drug? The one you bought at the gym?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.290
If you messed with Sae Bom, you're dead.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.840
It seems like there has been a misunderstanding.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.350
Then open this door right now.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.820
Where is Sae Bom?

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.180
Sae Bom!

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.630
What?

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.650
Hyun, are you hungry, too?

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.260
What?

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.090
Well, I came here because I missed you.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.520
- Help me out.
- What?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.830
- I said help me out. Stand up.
- What?

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.540
Come on, stand up.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.880
We are newlyweds so I missed her a lot.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.820
I mean, he worries about me even if he doesn't see me for a short while.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.190
You must... You must love her very much.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.570
Of course.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.840
What is it? Why?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.410
Do you want some?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.900
He has so many interesting things. Look.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.650
He also has a lot of food.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.320
- Weren't there any problems?
- No.

[Episode 7]

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.340
Then I'll see you later.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.550
Thank you for this.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.910
Hey, why did you do that? If he gets annoyed, he will hold a grudge for a long time.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.080
The gym trainer sold NEXT to that guy.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.900
Don't turn around. He might be watching us right now.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.960
No way. He is not some spy or anything...

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.090
Let me have a look at you.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.400
Did you get hurt anywhere? Did you get a scratch or...

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.920
feel a pinch behind your neck? Anything like that?

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.250
This isn't healing...

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.610
It has almost healed. It is not even that noticeable.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.260
Anyway, did anything seem strange besides the interior decoration?

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.050
He said his father was a diplomat so he traveled through Africa and the Middle East during his childhood.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.750
And that's how he realized that the end of the earth isn't too far off.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.140
So he is strange.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.480
But he seems nice. He gave me all this, too.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.290
These are super delicious when you're hungry.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.510
Everything is delicious when you're hungry.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.360
Who is it?

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.730
Hi.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.460
Little Girl, are you alone?

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.600
- Who are you, Ahjussi?
- Don't you know me?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.970
You know I'm your mom's friend.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.830
Can you open this?

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.680
If you just unlock...

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.660
Little Girl, why did you do that? You hurt my hand!

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.310
I'm sorry. Can you open the door for me?

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.990
I'm not a bad person.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.890
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.760
Do you have any medicine or something?

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.210
Where did you get hurt?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.250
How did you get in here?

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.880
The first-floor door was open.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.770
I'm not trying to do anything bad.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.160
I haven't even bitten anyone.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.760
I just feel so lonely and feel frustrated.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.990
Try to say that nonsense after wiping the blood off your mouth.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.560
Who did you bite?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.420
Just slightly...

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.370
I didn't bite a lot.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.630
He survived and ran away.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.120
Leave at the count of three.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.160
One,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.620
two, three!

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.660
Seo Yoon, it is Unni.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.870
Seo Yoon, it is Unni Sae Bom.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.160
Did that man leave?

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.930
Yes.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.620
- Where is Ahjussi Jung Gook?
- On the second floor.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.600
He went down because we are out of kitchen cleaners and toothpaste.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.660
I will be right back. Don't open the door no matter who asks you to open it.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.660
Just like how you did. Okay?

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.790
You did well, Seo Yoon.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.230
Eat this and calm yourself down. Okay?

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.160
- I will be right back.
- Okay.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.360
- I will be right back.
- Okay.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.370
How did he get inside?

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.390
There may be more inside. I have to look through the building.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:28.420
More important, I wonder whose blood he has on him.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.860
Ahjumma.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.770
Ahjumma, I'm not infected. Really!

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.870
Actually, I came here because the ahjumma from unit 1205 said she would give me money,

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:44.190
but with this lockdown and infection... What the hell is going on here?

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.030
Ahjumma, I will... I will help you.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.030
I will help you so we can both get out. Think about it. Have I...

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.440
Have I done anything strange? I haven't!

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.490
I just sat here quietly, didn't I?

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.630
- Aren't you thirsty?
- What?

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.390
Look.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.400
I'm fine, right?

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.930
I'm perfectly fine.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.720
I look fine, right?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.830
I will definitely help you, Ahjumma...

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.460
Ahjumma, you'll never be able to get out by yourself. Really.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.910
Ahjumma, help me out just this once.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.040
Thank you.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.300
I will trust you just this once.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.020
Are you okay?

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.000
Even if I drink...

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.800
Even if I drink, I'm still thirsty... What am I supposed to do?

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.830
Ahjumma, I'm all better now.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.630
Come over here. We have to go upstairs together.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.190
Will you keep standing there

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.580
until the infected people come?

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.530
Ahjumma, come on. Trust me!

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.420
Hyun...

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.650
Let's hurry.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.470
It is Na Soo Min's phone.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.450
[Mooil Group Construction, Bid Selection Celebration]

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.630
I mean, no matter how much I drink...

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.680
I feel parched.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.300
Where are Na Soo Min and Na Hyun Kyung?

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.560
I don't know, either.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.510
Kim Seung Beom, inhale and exhale deeply.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.820
Your desire will subside if you can just control your breathing.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.930
I mean...

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.810
I feel more thirsty the more I drink...

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.600
Do you know how tough that is when I know what I need to drink to quench my thirst?

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.700
when I know what I need to drink to quench my thirst?

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.860
What do you think will quench your thirst?

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.250
Human blood?

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.370
But how would you know that?

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.670
Who told you that?

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.330
I just know.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:15.140
When I see a pale neck, I become more thirsty.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.400
Do you think I'm not using a gun because I don't have one?

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.150
What are you doing here?

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.550
I came to help you two.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.310
Where is my brother?

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.060
We will look for him.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.220
Don't think about anything right now and get some rest.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.430
He must blame me.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.880
I asked him to come with me.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.720
It is a disease.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.120
We can only stand our ground until there is a treatment.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.180
Colonel, the treatment is almost ready, right?

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.220
These are sleeping pills. Take one whenever you need one.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.830
Take one now and get some rest.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.730
Let's go outside and talk.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.280
Can't you comfort her when she is struggling?

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.870
Why did you shoot him?

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:10.560
Kim Seung Beom. He was more than capable of communicating with us.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.900
There are tons of people who lost their families on the outside.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.460
A mom is biting her child, and a husband is biting his wife.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:20.090
If you don't want to lose someone close to you, you shouldn't hesitate, either, Yoon Sae Bom.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.110
This isn't healing. Why is that?

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:28.750
I know you looked at me when I was giving her water so tell me the truth.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.730
It means the virus is still present in your body. Sort of like debris.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.330
Could I end up biting people?

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.820
That is why I wanted to draw your blood every two weeks.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.660
We have to keep checking.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.560
Is that why you came here?

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.820
To draw my blood?

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.300
- It is because of Seo Yoon's parents.
- Is something wrong?

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.280
Her father has been infected.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.690
Her mother is fine, but she desperately misses her daughter.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.690
Then you came to take Seo Yoon with you?

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:02.860
The Madman Rabies situation is worsening not only in our country but globally.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.220
I have some news about the follow-up measures for the apartment, too,

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.480
so let's gather the residents after making sure the building is safe.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.310
My Lord...

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.230
Is it over?

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.100
You said they become normal once they drink blood.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.490
Maybe he bit someone and went home after coming to his senses.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.130
Is everyone okay in there?

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.100
Open the door!

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.170
Is anyone in there?

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.430
Hyun, are you okay?

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.450
You're not lying after getting bit, are you?

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.850
This isn't the fable "The Wolf And Lamb"!

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.620
Stop rambling nonsense and open the door!

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.060
He could be lying. He could!

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.860
- Don't you fall for his annoyingly good looks.
- My Lord...

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.200
Sir, I can hear everything.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.370
Open the door, Hyung.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.420
What is taking so long to open it?

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.680
- Hyung, what is wrong with you?
- I almost died!

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.190
Hey!

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.400
- Damn it!
- This is nuts.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.860
Never mind, Hyung. What exactly is going on?

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.650
Well, I came to get some cleaners and toothpaste,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.340
but the people with white eyes ran after us from the emergency exit.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.330
- Did anyone get hurt?
- No.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.190
Thanks to the pastor...

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.720
The pastor has spiritual powers.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.460
[Security]

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.520
- What are you talking about now?
- It is true!

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.890
No way...

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.590
I didn't have a gun at that point, but...

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.730
Oh, right. Hey, where is my gun?

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:21.160
- What?
- Gosh, calm down.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.350
Who opened the door on the first floor?

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.930
Well...

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.800
- The jobless guy on the second floor.
- He and the supermarket girl left the door open and ran away.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.490
Wait, Hyun...

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.670
Who shut the door behind me earlier?

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:51.460
Do you think they're okay downstairs?

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.300
What if someone got hurt?

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.790
All we need to do is make sure our stories match up.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.900
We have to say that we ran away after spotting infected people.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.560
No one can hold us responsible then.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.260
Hello.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.470
Miss, you're very pretty.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.470
What is your name?

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.760
I'm Lee Bo Ram.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.790
Thank you for the food, Ma'am.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.890
Mom, here.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.760
We are busy. Get out.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.270
All right.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:34.130
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Okay.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.310
Thank you.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.430
Don't the two of them look good together?

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.680
Don't get your hopes up.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.090
Who would fall for an unemployed guy like that?

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.690
Who cares about that?

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.260
Look at who I live with.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.690
What?

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.000
I think someone is here.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.840
Like I said, just make sure our stories match up.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.300
Don't say anything strange, okay?

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.550
We will speak in private. Don't mind us.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:18.700
No...

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.090
You two opened the door to the building, right?

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.860
What door?

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.170
We were here the whole time.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.970
Why? Why, why, why?

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.270
We went downstairs, and the door was open so we got scared and ran away. Really, really.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.340
Did you get bitten or scratched?

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.000
We just got scared and ran away. That is all. Really.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.220
I'm fine, too.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.250
Why did you go down to the first floor?

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.770
Did you go out because of this?

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:18.850
Gosh, give it to me. I have to do my show. I put my life on the line for that. Ouch!

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.880
Someone is missing because of you.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:33.320
If you're human, you should have a sense of responsibility, at least.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.930
Is everyone okay?

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:40.720
Well, for now.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.050
Geez, I barely held myself back from wanting to beat him up.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.840
Where is Han Tae Seok?

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.530
He went to the rooftop. He is looking for infected people.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.630
Is something wrong?

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:59.310
Seo Yoon's father has been infected.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.870
That is why he came.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:08.940
I'm here to help

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.450
so rest assured.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.960
Yes, it looks that way.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.390
Did any infected come up here?

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.640
Two of them came up, and I told them to go down that way.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.250
Oh, I broke that.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.770
When you told them to go down, did they just go?

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.700
There aren't any infected people inside the apartment.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:12.310
It looks like Na Soo Min went outside after being infected.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:16.470
You know his name, too. I guess you did your research before coming.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.570
Why did you come here?

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.820
You must have already heard from Yoon Sae Bom.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.970
Exactly.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.220
Are you taking Seo Yoon with you?

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.430
It's strange, though.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.850
The Han Tae Sok I know isn't all that caring.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.580
You even shot and killed someone earlier.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.530
I don't know what you're thinking,

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.830
but I'm only trying to stop the Madman Rabies situation.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.470
In that regard, I'm sure you also...

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.830
share my opinion.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.360
Are you sure Sae Bom is okay?

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.850
Her wound isn't healing.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.350
Unless her wound changes color, you don't have to worry.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:07.560
The Madman Rabies virus isn't harmful unless it goes to the brain.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:13.670
Besides Sae Bom, there are lots of people who have recovered from that condition, right?

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.100
There were four people.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.070
The recent examinations show that they've been infected.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.540
Ultimately, it is a matter of time.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.280
They couldn't avoid the disease.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.820
When will the cure be available?

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.280
I'm looking for an antibody that can penetrate the brain.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.060
Without that, the development of a cure

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.250
is impossible.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:43.440
So what you're saying is...

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.390
The situation...

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.500
will continue to worsen

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.930
until we find the antibody.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:56.240
What are you doing?

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.450
I gathered the residents so come downstairs.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.950
I will tell Seo Yoon first.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.420
There is something her mother wanted me to tell her.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.690
May I talk to her alone?

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.760
You're Seo Yoon.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.780
You're the ahjussi from TV, right?

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.500
The one who talks about the Madman Rabies.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.220
Yes, you're pretty smart.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.630
I hear that a lot.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.850
Can I speak to you for a moment?

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.700
Would you like to eat something?

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.220
We have combat ration.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.580
Ahjussi?

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.760
What?

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.920
Oh, okay.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.160
Let's eat the combat ration next time.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.100
I'm here to check up on you today.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.050
I promised your parents, Seo Yoon.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.180
Do you know my mom and dad?

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.500
Park Yong Cheol and Kang Eun Ji. I saw them this morning, too.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.120
Do they miss me?

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.180
Very much.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.140
Do you want to meet them?

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.740
If you want, you can get out of here.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.730
Can Unni Sae Bom go out with me?

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:54.310
Of course. Yoon Sae Bom's mother is outside, too.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.870
Sae Bom must also...

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:00.270
miss her mom a lot just like you, Seo Yoon.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.860
You decide, Seo Yoon. I will help you.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:25.490
- Hyun, you know...
- When Seo Yoon leaves, why not go with...

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.320
Go ahead.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:34.700
What will you do if you end up catching the disease?

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.170
What disease?

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.160
Madman Rabies.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.120
Since there is a chance...

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.680
you could catch it...

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.030
Yes. Of course, I could catch it.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.480
It isn't like we did anything wrong to catch it.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:01.900
By chance, if I catch the disease...

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.510
and get thirsty and want to...

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.270
bite people...

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.010
I will be sure to tell you.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.820
So...

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.910
be sure you tell me if anything happens to you.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.450
I will.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.790
I spoke with her. Let's go and meet the residents.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.470
Your son almost killed us!

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.250
How dare you glare at me like that? You're so much younger than me!

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.690
Didn't you catch the disease or something?

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:40.230
Do these eyes look like I caught the disease? Do they look like it?

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.310
Who exactly!

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.790
Told everyone to gather here without going through the Building Representative?

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.040
I heard an outsider has entered the building.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.370
Has anyone seen him?

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.740
Did you see him? Who is it?

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.300
A soldier.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.170
Are you sure you weren't mistaken? I don't think you can see well.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.250
Are you joking right now?

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.300
Step aside, please.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.850
The man from TV...

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:15.030
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae Seok from Central Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.510
Sir, has the lockdown been lifted?

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:21.630
- Really?
- Has it been lifted?
- Can we get out?

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.670
When can we get out?

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:27.180
The entire city is in a lockdown,

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.790
and the electricity will be shut off in the apartment complex tonight.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.060
Wait, wh-why are you shutting off the electricity?

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.230
Are you telling all of us to die? What is this?

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.880
We plan to resolve this as soon as possible.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.460
If you were going to do this, you should at least lift the lockdown.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.410
You should let the healthy people leave at the very least. This is a violation of human rights.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:48.440
I mean, we don't even live here. Never mind the lockdown or whatnot. You should let us go home at least.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.460
Colonel, the people are exhausted.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.660
Would shutting them out resolve the issue?

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:57.480
I-I-I know a hoobae who is a one-star general.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.710
- The phone. Give me your phone. Let me make a call.
- Sir, Sir...

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.110
A phone call will end all this.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:08.040
- That's not important right now.
- Just one phone call...

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.830
What is that?

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.690
What is that?

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.400
This is a real situation.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.330
People of South Korea, this is a real situation.

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:29.680
From this point on, the entire city of Seyang will be under martial law.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.000
- Martial law?
- This is a real situation.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.430
People of South Korea, this is a real situation.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:38.970
I will go and check up on Seo Yoon.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.310
- I will go to the gym.
- Should I go with you?

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:44.620
No, I will go with Hyung Jung Gook later.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.270
Be careful. If it is dangerous, don't hesitate.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.330
If something happens, I will take all the blame.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.650
Don't worry.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:13.880
The government is trying to stop the spread of the Madman Rabies and the false information

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:19.220
while break-ins, assaults, and other crimes have been increasing,

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.230
resulting in the disturbance of societal order.

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:24.700
In order to restore public safety and order,

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.360
protect the people's lives and property

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.990
to end this crisis and maintain order,

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.550
we are declaring emergency martial law in the city of Seyang.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.790
Unni.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:39.120
From this point on, the people...

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.910
It is okay, it is okay. They're only making it sound serious.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:56.100
As you heard, it is dangerous outside as well.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.770
Four days.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:03.750
The martial law will lift in four days and the level of the apartment complex lockdown will be lowered.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:05.670
Why are you shutting off the electricity?

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.860
There are infected people inside the power plant, too.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:13.170
Not only this place but the electricity will be cut off everywhere except for a few essential locations.

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:15.290
- What?
- Just like this place,

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:19.240
the entire Seyang city residents' ability to go outside will be limited.

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.170
Is it really that bad outside?

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:26.050
Everyday necessities and drinking water are short overall right now.

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:29.890
Violent incidents continue to occur from everywhere in the city.

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:33.040
Well, then, I guess it could be better to stay inside.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.160
All right. We have endured well all this time.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.020
Four days? That could be a short time.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.540
Trust me, and let's endure a little bit longer.

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:53.180
That Madman Rabies... I thought you could catch the disease if you take this one drug.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.320
Is it true?

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:02.010
We are still working on confirming the facts regarding the nature of the disease.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.480
It is true. That is it.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:19.590
Now, go home and get the stuff you need. Fill up your sinks and bathtubs with water.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:25.130
When the electricity shuts off, the water will be shut off as well.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.510
Don't worry too much.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:37.540
Overcoming a national crisis is our nation's special character.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.150
Thank you, Attorney.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.380
I will go and fill up our bathtub, too.

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:58.860
Seo Yoon.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.250
You talked to the soldier ahjussi, right?

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:06.650
I don't know too well how things are going in the outside world.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:12.160
It could be better than here, or it could be worse.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:16.400
Do you want to meet your mom and dad, Seo Yoon?

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.720
I don't drink that much water.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:30.150
I'm not saying this because I feel that you're a burden.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:35.540
If you say you want to stay here, I will do my best to protect you, Seo Yoon.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.600
And I will let you meet your parents.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:42.450
I'm just asking how you feel, Seo Yoon.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:47.810
I do want to meet them, but that soldier ahjussi is strange.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.730
Why? How so?

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:54.190
He's just a bit... He seems to be interested in you, Unni.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:56.750
He asked me how you've been.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.890
He asked if you're sick, too.

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:21.180
Will this work?

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:33.740
It might be dangerous outside. I will be right back.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.550
Where is Seo Yoon?

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.650
She wants you to give it to her mom and dad.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:03.530
If you're concerned about Seo Yoon leaving alone, you can go out with her.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.620
If not now, you don't know when Seo Yoon will get to meet her parents–

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.850
Why did you come here?

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.190
To resolve this situation, I came to find even the slightest possibility.

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:18.990
I think you came to get me, but I don't know why.

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.800
Does it have anything to do with this?

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.390
I guess you could say that.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:34.430
We found an antibody in you.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:38.070
We have to check and see if that antibody is useful.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:43.380
Even if we have to let you get bitten by an infected, if necessary.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.390
Don't shoot!

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:11.720
What?

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.200
Didn't you just hear a gunshot?

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:20.650
It's martial law. Someone must be shooting a warning shot.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:27.790
Hey, Hyun. You're close to Han Tae Seok, right?

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.010
No.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:34.960
Hey. When he leaves, could you ask him to take me with him?

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:39.420
I'm having a hard time.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.390
Are you worried about your wife?

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.970
All right. I will ask him.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:51.010
I'm sure your wife is okay, Hyung. Don't worry.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.530
Didn't you say Kim Seung Beom is dead?

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.520
Yes, over there...

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.740
[Le Ciel]

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.140
This is...

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.040
They cut out his brain.

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.060
Why would they do that to the dead?

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:30.360
I'm looking for an antibody that will penetrate the brain.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:34.430
Before that, the development of therapeutics is impossible.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.010
This isn't healing.

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.860
Unless her wound changes color, you don't have to worry.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:42.700
The Madman Rabies virus isn't harmful unless it goes to the brain.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.540
He came to take Sae Bom with him.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.790
To find an antibody.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.170
Hyung, you watch this spot.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.430
Make sure you stop Han Tae Seok if he shows up.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.050
Seo Yoon, why are you out here? It's dangerous. Go back inside. Okay?

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:29.560
I heard a gunshot. Is Unni okay?

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:33.980
She went outside with a pair of scissors earlier. To give him my letter.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.000
Let's go inside.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:43.030
Unni is a much better fighter than me. You know that, right?

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.160
So you don't have to worry at all.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.590
Go home and be sure to lock the door.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.180
I will be right there. Got it?

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.680
S-Sae Bom...

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.540
Yoon Sae Bom is sick. Step aside.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.580
Sae Bom is injured. Han Tae Seok took her.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.030
Obtained my target. Coming up.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:13.110
Don't feel too sorry for the infected.

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:15.390
They can control their thirst,

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:17.620
as long as they're willing.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:07.380
If you hurt Sae Bom, you're dead.

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:16.060
Stay still if you don't want to die.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.830
The tranquilizer was potent enough to put an elephant to sleep.

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:22.290
I guess I'm stronger than an elephant.

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:25.530
I'm letting you off because you didn't kill that man earlier.

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:43.340
Sae Bom, did you get hurt?

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.370
It's okay. I'm fine.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:47.380
Calm down.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:51.480
Lieutenant, long time no see.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.550
If you don't want this to get ugly, please tell them to lower their guns.

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.600
Lower your guns.

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:17.770
Yoon Sae Bom.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.810
What can I offer you for you to take the exam?

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.000
You bastard.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.130
Hey.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:50.010
I'm not doing this because I like you guys.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:53.220
I'm doing it since it helps with finding treatment.

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.360
Thank you.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.070
Wait.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:12.330
Please prepare lunch boxes for the apartment residents with lots of meat.

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:18.970
And I heard that you took Kim Seung Beom's body.

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:26.060
I'm sure you need to follow the procedure to take care of the body, but please relay the news to his family.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.920
The situation on the outside isn't too good. It will take some time to contact them.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.650
And my mom...

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:38.330
Your mom is doing well in the nursing home.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:42.760
Colonel took good care of her. Don't worry.

00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:48.760
So why did you cut into Kim Seung Beom's brain?

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.060
Are you looking for an antibody?

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.540
I told you that the Madman Rabies virus affects the brain, right?

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.860
When we test the blood of a diseased dead, sometimes we find an antibody.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:04.310
It's just that it can't penetrate the brain.

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:08.900
The antibody is in the body, but it can't penetrate the brain. That is the problem.

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:15.100
So that is why you penetrated the infected people's brains, to see if an antibody was in their brains.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.500
How about Sae Bom?

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.800
Were you going to penetrate Sae Bom's brain, too?

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.470
No. We have to take her blood.

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:29.380
And we can experiment with her blood.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:38.080
Can you develop the cure with Sae Bom's blood?

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.410
A new type of monoclonal antibody was discovered in Yoon Sae Bom's blood.

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:48.640
We have to examine further, but...

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.100
it is possible that it could penetrate the barrier inside the brain and get to the brain.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:56.840
That means Sae Bom is a crucial person for our country right now.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.150
That's possible.

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:00.280
Then give us a few weapons

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.490
to protect Sae Bom.

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.260
Will you be okay?

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:09.510
What about?

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:11.740
The existence of an antibody isn't a certainty yet.

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.500
Yoon Sae Bom can develop symptoms at any given point.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.390
That's why I should be next to her so I can watch her. Right next to her.

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.050
Hyun!

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:27.320
Hey, I'm finished!

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.190
The blood has been drawn.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:33.860
Let's go. I will give you the supplies you want.

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.470
So why are you going this far?

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:40.810
Sneaking into the apartment and all. Well, wanting to save the infected...

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:44.110
Don't say useless things like that.

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:52.460
It is because of the money.

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.780
Many rich and powerful people are infected, too.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.240
That is why we are taking care of this secretly.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:02.730
If the word spreads, even if we have to draw all the blood from Yoon Sae Bom's body,

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.560
they'll want to be the first ones to heal.

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:10.500
Then the development of a cure that is truly worth a fortune will be delayed.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:20.890
You want money, and I want Sae Bom. Don't ever mess with us again.

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:28.000
And, after all this is over, I will expose everything you did. Know that.

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:31.970
Do that.

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:34.870
I will take responsibility for everything I did.

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:54.780
Ahjussi, no smoking.

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.640
Open the door.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.270
- Are you okay, Hyung?
- Oh, yes...

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:16.940
The blood all over Sae Bom's face earlier...

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.430
That wasn't Sae Bom's blood.

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:22.180
Don't worry, Hyung.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.560
- Hyun.
- Yes?

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.400

I heard something big had happened in the gym.

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:52.630
Is the lady on the fourth floor okay?

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:55.870
I will let you know if I need your help.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.270
I will take this.

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:18.730
I told you, just eat whatever.

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:21.620
I'm looking at the expiration date. Geez...

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:14.040
I thought he would kill him, but he shot him once to graze his shoulder, then stopped.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:17.140
And he didn't wait for me to get bitten, either.

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:25.460
Don't shoot!

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.020
But he's still bad.

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:10.710
I know that,

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:15.890
but he seemed pretty desperate, too.

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:43.440
Four days. We just have to endure it for four days.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.890
Then everything will get back to normal.

No. He's really not it.

Well, is the pastor home?

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:42.700
I wanted to thank him for saving my life...

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.720
and I wanted to pray.

Hello.

- Okay.

What else would I do in here?

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:08.000
Take the trash out.

Oh Joo Hyung makes a guest take the trash out in his house?

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:01.060
Give it to me.

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:21.610
To throw this out properly, the lockdown has to get lifted anyway.

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:25.500
What's wrong?

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.040
Should I go downstairs and throw this out?

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:31.240
I'm so scared.

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:40.880

Oh Joo Hyung killed his wife.

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.650
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:09.890
He told me.

00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:13.240
If you don't help me, he will kill me, too.

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:17.970
I thought I would be fine if I just got out of here, but now we are under martial law.

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:21.710
Of course, I must help you.

00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:29.030

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:33.490
This is my usual dress.

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:36.710
I can't keep wearing your wife's clothes.

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:40.960
Are you thirsty?

Run it only at a lab that has level-three biosafety.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.810
Yoon Sae Bom woke up after getting a tranquilizer shot.

01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:36.200
But that much tranquilizer should have put anyone to sleep.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.280
The virus could have gotten into her brain.

Being able to recover quickly is what the infected have in common.

But the test result came out clean.

01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:48.640
It's possible that her body has working antibodies.

Proceed carefully so the higher-ups don't get wind of this.

Yes, Sir.
