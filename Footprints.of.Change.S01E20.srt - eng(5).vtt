00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.660
[Episode 20]

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.330
I've made some stylistic changes
this time.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.330
Look at the draft.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.640
I can see that.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.770
It's so beautiful.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.400
Great Designer Yi!

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:56.570
Great Designer Yi!

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.229
Hello, hello.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.229
Getting off work?

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.510
Hello, hello.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.330
Comrade Xiurong, you're here too.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.820
Feels like forever since I last saw you.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.150
Now, I'm working as a reporter

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.430
for the newspaper.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.360
Since our workshop is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.820
a pilot for state-private joint ownership,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.230
I'm particularly interested in
learning about

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.870
the people hereâ€”

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.430
ordinary workers,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.560
labor representatives,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.240
capitalists,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.300
and also designers

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.650
and artists like you.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.160
And where...

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.760
where does your design inspiration
come from?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.120
What do you want to know?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.030
Well, for example,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.310
when I just came in,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.030
I saw you

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.620
admiring your work.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.130
It's gorgeous.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.970
This is an attempt to
blend Chinese and Western styles.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.040
Chinese and Western styles...

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.280
Then,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.360
what does this mean?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.090
This comes from the flying apsaras dance
from the Dunhuang murals.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.370
Right, right.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.920
Reporter Yang, have you been to Dunhuang?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.960
Dunhuang.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.960
Dunhuang...

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.840
I-I'll go chat with the workers,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.430
the fellow workers.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.650
I'll have... have a quick chat with them.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.910
You carry on, carry on.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.030
Newly made?

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.340
It's very well done.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.960
Yi.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.329
Does Minister Wen know

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.050
that Reporter Yang is here
to interview you?

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.450
What does this have to do
with Minister Wen?

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.200
He could help review it for you.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.530
Xiurong,

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.290
I don't want any special privileges,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.050
and I don't want people to find a reason

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.180
to criticize Minister Wen through me.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.560
I take responsibility for everything I do.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.020
Even if you think this way,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.840
others will still think
you have privileges.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.700
I can't control what others think.

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.079
I only make sure I do my own part well.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.240
Does your work have a mix of styles?

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.590
Does your work have...

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.310
Let me show you this one.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.170
A blend of Chinese and Western...

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.240
Hello?

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.210
I'm not disturbing you
while you're on duty, am I?

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.730
I thought you would say,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.310
"I'm not disturbing your rest, am I?"

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.960
You wouldn't be resting at this hour.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.080
Neither would I.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.050
How are your designs coming along?

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.840
Do you need my advice?

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.630
No.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.720
Why?

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.060
Looking down on this layman?

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.430
Of course.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.030
Laypeople can't guide professionals.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.900
Comrade Wen Pu.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.630
Yes, Ma'am.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.440
I order you to stop staying up late

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.390
and go to bed now.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.090
I'll follow your order, Ma'am.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.140
You should rest early too.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.270
Good night.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.500
Good night.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.010
Yi!

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.950
Yi!

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.000
-Here, Xiurong.
-Yi!

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.020
Look at this article quickly.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.600
Here.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.040
The article

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.560
doesn't mention your name,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.600
but the factory leaders

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.720
called me.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.270
They think the designer
mentioned in the article

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.430
is you.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.970
These aren't my final drafts.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.950
How did they end up
in Yang Xue'an's hands?

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.040
How did you handle your drafts?

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.840
I gave them to the pattern makers

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.050
so they could make samples for me to see.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.010
Then they must've made a mistake.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.070
They must have mistaken these

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.680
for your final designs.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.160
I'm going to find Yang Xue'an now.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.690
No, I have to ask him myself!

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.560
How could he use my discarded drafts?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.850
How could he write it up like this?

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.560
If Yang Xue'an did this on purpose,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.310
would arguing with him help?

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.830
Then who can defend me?

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.409
Go to Minister Wen.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.360
He's a leader

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.409
and an old revolutionary.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.070
-I'm sure he can...
-I repeat!

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.310
I will not drag others down
for something I did myself.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.190
Is Minister Wen "others"?

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.850
Xiurong, look at this headline.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.760
"New Trends in Class Struggle."

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.020
This is a big deal!

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.720
Yi.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.650
This article does come across
as a bit radical.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.190
But you're someone
who has weathered great storms.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.190
Don't be nervous.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.600
It's not that I care

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.310
what others say about me.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.560
They can say whatever they want.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.950
But my actions now

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.360
no longer represent just myself!

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.480
I understand.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.500
How about this:

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.620
I'll go talk to the factory leaders again.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.420
Is that okay?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.270
Just...

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.070
please don't say anything rash
or do anything impulsive,

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.750
okay?

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.870
Just wait for me here.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.220
I'll be back soon.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.170
Wait for me here!

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.150
Hello?

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.230
Hello.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.090
I know all about the news report.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.550
I'm afraid of getting you involved.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.310
I'm going to talk to Yang Xue'an myself.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.360
Don't be nervous,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.760
and don't overthink it.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.950
Go to the water town

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.030
and lie low for a while.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.230
Leave this matter to me.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.750
What about you?

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.750
Don't worry.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.990
I'll handle everything.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.820
Comrade Zhou,

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.120
I was planning to
talk to the factory leaders,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.120
but I don't think it would help much.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.310
This issue has already spread to
the city level,

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.240
so I asked you to come.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.680
Let's figure something out together.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.070
What can I do?

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.160
How could Yang Xue'an do something
like this?

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.600
Isn't he your boyfriend?

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.270
Yi?

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.310
Yi!

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:33.750
Yi!

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.830
Where has she gone?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.270
Here's a note

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.270
and a letter.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.270
"Comrade Xiurong,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.950
in response to various opinions
about my design drafts,

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.920
I need to step out of the design room

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.180
to find more materials and inspiration
in society.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.060
Please give me some time.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.360
As long as the factory leaders trust me,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.870
I will persist in completing my designs."

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.640
There's also a letter.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.810
She wants me to pass it to Minister Wen.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.870
She must be afraid of
implicating Minister Wen.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:07.600
For heaven's sake,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.880
she hasn't done anything wrong.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.850
What is there to be afraid of?

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:10.850
Exactly.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.720
Xiurong, what are you doing?

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.270
Hello?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.490
Please connect me to the city government.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.490
Xiurong, don't make the call.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.480
She definitely doesn't want
Minister Wen to know,

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.810
and that's why she left.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.800
You intellectuals are just too concerned
with keeping up appearances.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.330
Who is Minister Wen anyway?

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.390
If he's afraid of
being implicated by others,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.250
then he wouldn't be Minister Wen.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:38.750
Hello?

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.320
Yes, yes.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.260
Minister Wen, I was just about to
call you.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.640
Okay, okay.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.650
Minister Wen will be here shortly.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.960
Minister Wen, this way.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.150
This way, please.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.700
Please.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.940
This is a letter from Yi Yi for you.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:29.960
Open the door.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.380
Aren't you afraid someone might hear us?

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.210
Open the door.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.880
Don't be so nervous.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.000
Please sit down.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.430
Minister Wen.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.240
Here's a stool.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.720
You can sit while you read.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.250
No need. I'm fine standing.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.350
Then let me...

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.670
pour you some tea?

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.400
Would you like some?

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.170
[I'll take care of myself. Don't worry.]

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.070
What did my sister-in-law say?

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.980
Don't worry.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.270
She'll be fine.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.290
She will take care of herself.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.120
Minister Wen.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.790
Oh right,

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.030
look.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.510
These are Designer Yi's
latest design drafts.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.150
Reporter Yang's article

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.770
used her discarded drafts.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.600
I know Designer Yi.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.120
She's just a simple designer

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.270
who wants to make these export products

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.870
beautiful and elegant

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.910
to satisfy foreign buyers.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:40.910
Look,

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.310
these lines really capture
the beauty of our Chinese style.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.670
I heard she drew inspiration from
the Dunhuang flying apsaras murals.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.270
Xiurong,

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.370
the report this time

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.670
also interviewed your factory's
Chief Designer Tang.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.470
Many of the quotes were from him.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.450
Does he have a lot of influence?

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.050
Regarding this matter,

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.120
I've verified with Designer Tang.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.050
There was indeed a reporter named Yang

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.110
who called him.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.120
However,

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.130
he wasn't familiar with the situation

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.330
and gave some vague answers
to the reporter's questions.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.070
Reporter Yang

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.870
clearly didn't look into things carefully
this time.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.480
His thinking is too arbitrary

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.550
and rigid!

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.910
He always tries to

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.240
make everything into something serious!

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.240
Minister Wen,

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.730
this matter has had quite an impact.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.770
Even the city's foreign trade officials
have inquired about it.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:31.650
Really?

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.620
Some people don't bother to
learn the facts.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.680
They just spread whatever they hear.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.630
Minister,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.240
what about my sister-in-law?

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.090
It's okay.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.550
This matter

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.840
can get more people involved in

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.040
the discussion about cultural exchange
between China and the West.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.120
It's a good thing.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.910
It also increases
your factory's visibility.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.870
How is that a good thing?

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.000
The more people discuss it,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.240
the worse it gets for my sister-in-law!

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.920
Minister Wen.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.350
You're really going to let this happen?

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.280
Relax.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.390
When this matter is
brought before the masses,

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.350
the truth will become clearer
through debate.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:12.820
What if it doesn't?

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.240
Minister Wen,

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.870
we're counting on you regarding Ms. Yi.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:22.730
She'll be fine.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.320
Sir,

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.750
-I'd like an order of fried tofu puffs.
-Hello.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.680
Coming right up!

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.960
Miss, here you go.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.320
Thanks. Here's the money.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.920
What were you thinking,
writing this article?

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:47.910
Did you get

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.910
Yi Yi's consent before publishing this?

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.030
You took her discarded drafts

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.000
and made such a big deal out of them,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.240
writing such a provocative headline!

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:53.750
Do you realize

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.630
this could have serious consequences?

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:56.630
Can you calm down?

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.430
If you can calm down,

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.140
we can talk.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.120
-What are you looking at?
-If you can't calm down,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.040
I'll leave now.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.790
I'm sorry.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.720
Am I not calm enough?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.180
I'm asking you questions.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.630
First,

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.460
my work

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.840
doesn't require anyone's approval.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.440
Second...

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.750
I don't care
if those drawings were discarded

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.720
or official.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:22.790
The fact that she drew them

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.040
proves there's something wrong
with her thinking.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.360
She has reactionary thoughts.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.560
What I'm doing now is trying to save herâ€”

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.970
pulling her back from the edge of danger!

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:30.570
Xue'an,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.100
what's wrong with you?

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.630
There's something seriously wrong
with your thinking right now!

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.630
You're being too radical, you know that?

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.200
Look...

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.390
Look, Minister Wen and Director Fang

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:38.840
didn't say anything about this matter...

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.320
Don't mention Minister Wen to me.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.030
They didn't say anything!

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.890
Don't mention Minister Wen to me!

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.310
I used to work
in the Anti-Capitalist Office.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.470
I put all my passion and effort into it.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.870
He looked down on me!

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.440
He was biased against me

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.180
and transferred me away from my position!

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.790
I could have had a bright future!

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:56.390
And you?

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.550
As my girlfriend,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.380
have you ever spoken up for me?

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.630
Have you ever considered things
from my perspective?

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.260
For the sake of that job back then,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:08.990
my mother...

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.870
You want to talk about your mother, right?

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:11.240
Yang Xue'an,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.320
you brought this up yourself.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:12.870
Leave my mother out of this.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.670
When your mother was sick,

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.390
critically ill,

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.150
you didn't even go back to see her!

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.070
Leave my mother out of this!

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.030
Do you regret it or not?

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.550
Leave my mother out of this!

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.030
Do you regret it or not?

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.480
You have no right!

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:18.960
Do you regret it?

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.020
You have no right to reopen my wounds!

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.040
Zhou Yunqing.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.130
Before...

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.660
when you agreed to date me,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.190
I thought you valued me as a person.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.200
Now I understand.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.730
You were only interested in
my position back then.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.170
You were attracted to my power!

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.230
You were in love with my power, not me!

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.130
Turns out you're actually quite insecure.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.930
I always thought
you were full of confidence.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:11.690
Get lost!

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:54.630
Minister Wen.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.240
-Minister Wen.
-Come in.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.910
Minister Wen.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:00.720
What can I do for you?

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.520
Minister Wen,

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.120
I brought Yang here today

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.490
to apologize on behalf of the newspaper.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.680
W-We're sorry.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.080
Have a seat.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.610
No, we won't sit, Minister Wen.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.940
We don't deserve to sit.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.550
We're too embarrassed to sit.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.720
I've heard from readers

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.500
that Yang's article was somewhat biased

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.200
and stirred controversy.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.280
We're sorry.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.510
Yes, Minister Wen.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.630
It was my negligence at work.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.690
I apologize to you.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.850
Would it be acceptable
to make amends this way?

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.270
We'll publish another article
in the newspaper's name,

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.180
stating that I, Yang Xue'an, failed

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.740
to properly review the clothing design

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.870
and hereby formally apologize
to Ms. Yi Yi.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.800
Would that work?

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.740
I suggest

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.200
we explore this topic further.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.950
Invite authorities from various fields

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:45.920
to discuss

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.120
the exchange and interaction
between Chinese and Western cultures.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.960
An open discussion?

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.510
Wouldn't that cause

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.970
even more harm to Ms. Yi Yi?

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.080
I suggest we still apologize,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.320
sincerely apologize.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.780
I have faith in the masses.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:02.410
I believe even more that the truth
will only become clearer through debate.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:05.940
Editor-in-Chief Ji.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.720
I'm leaving this in your hands.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.790
Yes, Minister Wen.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.160
Comrade Yang,

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.150
I also look forward to
your excellent follow-up reports.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:15.450
Okay.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.440
We'll be going now, Minister Wen.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.180
Go ahead.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.089
We'll head back first.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.720
What's Minister Wen really up to?

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.680
Scholar.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.630
If one day I run into trouble,

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.570
will you help me?

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.510
Of course, I will.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.650
But it depends on what kind of trouble

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.180
and whether I can be of help.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.580
Lend me some money to cover a shortfall.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.200
How much?

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.000
10,000 yuan.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.480
Are you kidding me?

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.920
Do you think I'm made of money?

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.720
See? See?

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.980
I knew you couldn't help me.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.880
I was just kidding.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.480
I just wanted to test you.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.340
Well, well. Getting cunning now, huh?

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.800
You've learned to test me.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.440
You know what?

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.270
If you're really in trouble,

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.540
I have some money saved up.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.160
I can have Mrs. San
bring it to you tomorrow.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.230
Forget it.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.730
You don't have much money yourself.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.550
Oh, right, you told me

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.680
you have a classmate
who's a leader in the Northeast, right?

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.880
Yes, Liu Tao.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.440
He's the regional party secretary.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.130
Why?

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.720
How's your relationship with him?

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.520
Pretty good.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.580
We were roommates in college,

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.750
and we've kept in touch all these years.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.620
Could you introduce us?

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.060
Why do you want to meet him?

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.670
Well...
with this construction project of mine,

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.100
all those materials and supplies

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.280
are shipped from the Northeast.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.390
I was thinking if I knew such a leader,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:04.750
maybe I could...

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.210
Could what?

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.940
You know, when the time comes, I could...

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.270
What are you getting at?

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:10.930
I'm telling you,

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.160
don't get any funny ideas.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.400
We absolutely cannot do anything

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.750
that violates principles or discipline.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.840
Look how serious you get.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.000
I knew you couldn't help me.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.110
Just...

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.030
Forget it.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:32.680
Tell me,

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.160
are you in some kind of trouble?

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.760
No.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.720
Really?

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.960
What trouble could I possibly have?

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.620
You can't hide things from me.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.690
What would I be hiding from you?

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:46.830
Alright, alright. I'm hungry.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.760
Have Mrs. San cook me some noodles.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.440
What time is it?

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.040
Mrs. San went to bed long ago.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.160
I'll make you some noodles.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.490
And I'll throw in an extra egg for you.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.010
Help yourself to some tea.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.580
[Comrade Wen Pu,]

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.140
[it's 8 o'clock in the evening now.]

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.970
[What are you doing right now?]

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.000
[You're definitely not telling
bedtime stories to Yuanyuan.]

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:31.930
[I know.]

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.790
[You're probably busy working again.]

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.110
[You probably haven't had dinner yet.]

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.400
[You promised me]

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.880
[you'd eat meals on time.]

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.910
[You need to keep your promise.]

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:43.480
[Oh, and

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.110
you should drink less coffee when working at night.]

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.200
[It's bad for your health]

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.660
[and affects your sleep.]

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.110
[There aren't many residents
in this town.]

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.040
[It's lively during market days,]

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.550
[but once the sun sets,]

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.350
[it gets frighteningly quiet.]

00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.750
[After some time,]

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:00.930
[I'll go back.]

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.840
[As soon as I return,]

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.650
[I'll come see you right away.]

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.480
[Don't worry about me.]

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.750
[Take good care of yourself.]

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.190
Just right.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.510
Scholar.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.110
You're really impressive.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.440
Well...

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.410
This whole matter about Yi Yi

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:28.970
caused such a big stir,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.680
yet you calmly and quietly

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.900
managed to handle it.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.530
Have you thought about

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.110
what if the public opinion

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.000
had shifted in Yang Xue'an's favor?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.260
What would you do then?

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.790
You went to the leadership, didn't you?

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.580
No, that's not it.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.430
That's not like your personality.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.520
So it was your own accurate judgment,

00:21:59.160 --> 00:21:59.760
wasn't it?

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:03.400
Impressive.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.620
Impressive. Truly impressive.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.790
Tomorrow,

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:11.920
I'm going to see her.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.070
Then I'll be your driver.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.310
Young lady, this color looks nice, right?

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.570
Why don't you try it on?

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:25.350
Okay.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.080
Here, take a look.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.080
Thank you.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:51.880
This color is lovely.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.390
It suits you. Makes you look so elegant.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.270
Beautiful, very beautiful.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.830
Young lady, you're just too gorgeous.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:59.160
Here.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.720
Take this mirror and see for yourself.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.040
Okay.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.170
Isn't it beautiful?

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.350
Honestly, you're stunning.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.440
You're absolutely stunning, young lady.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.320
Alright.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.450
Everyone is watching us.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.710
Let them watch.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.400
I want to hold you a little longer.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.480
Okay, I'll listen to you.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.360
Have you gained weight recently?

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:48.350
No.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.020
Your arms are fuller than before.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.670
Your stomach's gotten a bit rounder too.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.380
Really?

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.550
Young lady, don't just grab and run!

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.400
You haven't paid yet!

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:03.750
I'm sorry.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:04.550
-I'm sorry.
-I'll pay, I'll pay.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:05.350
Seriously...

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.270
We're so sorry.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.060
10 yuan.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:08.240
Okay, okay.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:09.370
Here.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.310
That's enough.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.440
Sir, you're very lucky.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:31.810
Yunqing.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:33.280
You're here.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.070
Yes.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.000
I didn't know you'd be so late,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.850
so I had a bit to drink myself.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.960
You know I don't usually drink.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.440
I asked you to come today

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.200
because I wanted to apologize to you.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:46.790
That day,

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.790
I was indeed too harsh with my words.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:49.550
And then

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:50.640
I scolded you.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.590
I'm sorry.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.050
I've reflected on it,
and I apologize to you.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.240
Just

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.700
think of today as us

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.240
going out to eat together.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.110
I ordered some dishes you love.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.730
We wouldn't normally splurge

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:03.930
on dishes like these.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.880
And this baijiu too.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.110
I just had some.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:08.000
This baijiu is aromatic.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.720
It's good.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.780
It cost me half a month's salary.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.510
Come on.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.500
Let's have a drink together.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:12.960
Come on.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.200
I don't want to drink.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:18.510
I want to talk to you
while we're both sober.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.800
Are you sober right now?

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.930
Of course I'm sober.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:22.880
Okay.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.230
I want to break up with you.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.920
Yunqing.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.390
Look, I told the chef not to put

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.340
chopped green onions on this dish.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.030
You know, sometimes dishes

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.410
taste better without green onions,

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.660
a different kind of flavor...

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:46.790
Looks like you're not sober enough.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.720
And this meat...

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.790
You must love this meat. Usually you...

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.070
I think
you're still not clear-headed enough.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.640
I didn't want to come today.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.640
But I thought I should come

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.370
and make things clear with you.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.030
During this period,
I've been thinking about us.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.360
It all feels like a blur.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.280
Maybe all of this between us
was just a misunderstanding.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.000
I already apologized to you.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.730
If it's because that day

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:18.350
I was too harsh

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.440
and scolded you,

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.300
you can scold me back.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.510
If that's not enough,

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:23.680
you can even hit me.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.310
It's not because you scolded me.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:26.110
Then why?

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.550
Because we're not right for each other.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.110
How are we not right for each other?

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.910
In what way are we incompatible?

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.510
Was I not good
when I taught you calligraphy?

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.840
Was I not good
when I taught you how to cook?

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:41.840
I know you don't like green onions.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.730
Since then, I've never added green onions

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:44.610
to any dish I've made.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.610
But you know what?

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.260
I actually like green onions!

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:47.910
Waiter!

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:50.090
Add some green onions to this dish

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:51.090
and cook it again.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.930
You'll regret this.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:32.830
Let's sit here.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:33.560
Sure.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.650
Waiter, a pot of tea.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.830
Thank you.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:47.470
Thank you.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.750
Here.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:58.350
It smells so good.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.350
These past few days,

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.550
the newspapers have been discussing

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.280
your design drafts intensely.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.250
Do you know that?

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.700
There aren't any Shanghai newspapers here.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.570
This matter has become very serious now.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.740
You should know about it.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.120
I brought you a newspaper.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:26.950
Take a look.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:32.950
I'm afraid to read it.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.150
What are you doing?

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.300
Sit down first.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:42.720
Come on.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.000
No matter how serious something is,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.240
you have to face it.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.790
Take a look.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.110
This article.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:09.390
Come on.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.710
[Inheritance and Innovation: Promoting
Dunhuang Culture in Fashion Design]

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.980
What do you think about what he wrote?

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.050
What do you think about what he wrote?

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:51.860
I think

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.040
he wrote it very well.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:55.590
It's well-reasoned

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.480
and redirects all those baseless

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.940
and exaggerated opinions

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.790
into

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.000
an academic discussion.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.150
Don't you think?

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.620
You ordered him to write it this way?

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.380
I didn't.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.550
But the matter is resolved now.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.550
Put away your newspaper
and drink your tea.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.240
Yes, Ma'am.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.050
Wait.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.470
Let's celebrate with tea instead of wine.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.570
What a pity.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.310
There is

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.790
an opera troupe performing in town
tonight.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:42.830
They sound amazing.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.360
I've watched their performance
once before.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.310
It's alright.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.920
If you want to hear opera,

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:50.250
Hangong sings well.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.360
Hangong.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.430
Sing one of your best folk songs.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.890
Come on, don't be so coy.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.100
Yes, Secretary Zhao,

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.830
I really love hearing you sing.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.320
Come on, sing on, sing on.

Ms. Yi.

Xiurong.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.030
Yi, you're back.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:55.200
These are gifts I bought

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.200
for your children in the water town.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:01.230
You bought one for each of my 5 children?

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.640
Yeah, gender equality.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.680
These must be expensive. How much?

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:07.810
Let me pay you back.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:09.390
Don't be so formal with me.

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:10.810
I heard from Minister Wen

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.200
that you kept speaking up for me
during the debate.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.330
I'm really touched.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:15.950
I was just telling the truth.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.420
I really dislike Yang Xue'an.

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:22.630
Did the factory leaders tell you?

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.630
Your work made it to the first round.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.510
Really?

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.780
That's wonderful.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:30.240
It wouldn't have made the shortlist
without your input.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:34.130
This is Wen Pu.

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:36.210
Do you have any news about the matter

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:37.540
I asked you to look into?

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.380
I asked around for you.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.540
Zhao's matter isn't that simple.

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:44.990
He's been behind on payments
to that factory for ages.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.390
Recently, that factory started
the state-private partnership.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.120
The audit found many problems.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.270
Among them, the accounts
between them and Zhao

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:52.550
are very unclear.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.060
What else?

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.530
I don't know the specifics.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.470
You should go to Zhao quickly.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.400
He knows best what he's done.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:03.990
I have a meeting soon.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.750
I have to go.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.550
Operator?

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.870
This is Wen Pu.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.230
Minister! There's a call from the city.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.570
They're requesting your presence
at an urgent on-site meeting.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:37.100
Alright.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.120
Operator? Hello?

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:45.800
The car is already waiting downstairs.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.380
Okay.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.410
Let's go.

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:16.400
Yi!

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:29.130
I want to talk to you about something.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.190
What is it?

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.490
I broke up with Yang Xue'an.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:35.550
Are you sad?

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.190
I'm not sad.

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.410
Minister Wen, you're finally back.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:03.920
Secretary Zhao's wife is here.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.490
She says she's been calling you
all afternoon

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:06.590
but couldn't get through.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.850
She's waiting inside.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.670
Jiang? Jiang.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.340
Political Commissar, you're finally back!

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.200
Alright, please sit down.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.680
Calm down. Take your time.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.310
Sit down.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.720
I was afraid this would happen!

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.840
See? It happened today.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.100
I knew it.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.480
I just knew it!

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:26.400
Slow down.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.130
Come on, sit down. Calm down a bit.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.380
My man owes them 10,000 yuan!

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.320
I never even dreamed of

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.440
such a large amount of money!

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.770
How can we ever pay that back?
10,000 yuan!

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:37.810
If we can't pay it back,

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.660
does that mean Hangong will have to
go to prison?

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.940
I've asked that regional party leader...

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.870
Please sit down first. Please sit.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.070
How did he end up owing so much money?

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:49.140
I only know

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:50.510
that he's been...

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.710
keeping a pretty young mistress
in Shanghai.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:54.410
I heard

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.690
she used to be some kind of socialite.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.290
She really knows how to please men!

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.150
I don't know when,

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:02.150
but she got my husband hooked on her.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.330
Women like her

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.230
never have enough!

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:08.800
Hangong rented her

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.530
a very, very expensive garden villa
in Shanghai.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.480
She even didâ€”what do you call itâ€”

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.080
some speculative business.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.310
Ended up losing everything!

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.400
That money all came from my husband!

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.480
Sir, you know it.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:23.570
Hangong never had that kind of money!

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.160
He took on those projects

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.680
all for that pretty young woman!

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.430
What should we do?

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:33.600
Well,

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.500
all that money's what Hangong

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:37.770
stole from the state.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:39.410
A total of 10,000 yuan.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.550
Where am I supposed to find that money?

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:42.900
Our family has no money!

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:46.080
All our relatives are even poorer
than we are!

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.400
What are we going to do?

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:49.420
Alright.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:51.430
Jiang, here's what we'll do.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:52.600
You should go home first.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.070
I'll figure something out.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.130
Let me look into the situation first,

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.660
and I'll let you know
as soon as I have any news.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:00.280
Don't worry too much. Go home first.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.550
Your children need you at home.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.350
Go home first.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.230
Minister Wen,

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.930
Hangong is

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.920
the only son for three generations.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.800
Please,

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.000
take this matter seriously.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.830
Don't worry. I'll think of a way.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:20.780
Jiang!

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:21.800
Please get up! Get up!

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.400
On behalf of our whole family...

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.150
Please get up!

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.550
My husband...

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:25.630
Get up, get up.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.110
Get up!

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.150
When there are problems,
we find solutions.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.840
Go home now.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.190
We'll repay your kindness.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:32.970
Alright, alright.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:33.360
Thank you.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.110
Go back first. Go back.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.530
Operator, please connect me
to Minister Wen's home.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.080
Sorry,

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.150
Minister Wen's line is busy.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.360
Thank you.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:50.270
That's the whole situation.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.440
In short, it's a serious matter.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.070
Anyway,

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.550
we need to
cover this deficit first, right?

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:57.880
He owes that much money.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.920
Please help figure something out.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.360
I've been calling everyone else

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.110
in the division I can reach.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.160
I have to go now.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.650
I'll wait for your news.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:09.960
I have a long-distance call
from G-Guangzhou coming in.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.120
It might be Ziliang.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.060
Okay, okay.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.440
Hello?

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:16.470
Ziliang.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:17.760
I'm sorry

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.000
for calling so late.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.460
Here's the thing.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.510
Um...

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.810
Zhao Hangong is in trouble.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.430
He owes a lot of money.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.590
Public funds, of course.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.320
So we need to...

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.860
we need to cover this deficit first.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.180
I've already contacted Huang Kuisheng.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.630
Do you have Jiaxing's contact information?

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:42.690
Give me the number.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.550
Alright, I've noted it down.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.410
How much money can you help raise?

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.030
It's really urgent.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.880
Great. Great.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.710
I'll wait for your news then.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.070
Okay, okay.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.710
I'll call Jiaxing now.

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:05.320
Where is he?

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.360
Tianjin.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.560
Alright, I'll call this number.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.160
Okay, I'll wait for your news.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:13.560
It's extremely urgent.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.190
Well?

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.560
I've borrowed money from
all the old comrades-in-arms

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.800
from our old division.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.260
Altogether, I've gathered over 5,000 yuan.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.600
I've had them wire it all to Jiang,

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.360
who is keeping it for now.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:47.260
I'm asking how you are doing.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.280
Zhao really acted foolishly.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.190
As a leading cadre,

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:54.320
he's received
so many years of Party education,

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.780
yet he made such a mistake!

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.850
He must take responsibility
for his actions!

00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.800
Ms. Fang,

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:02.590
you and the Chief

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.130
have watched us grow and develop.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.460
You both know Hangong well, right?

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.070
At heart, he's different from

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.800
Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan,

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.800
right?

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.400
I know that.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.590
He's just lustful.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.140
He can't resist beautiful women.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.280
And now his whole life is ruined
because of it.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.280
So I was wondering

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.900
if you could tell the Chief

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.230
to give him a chance to redeem himself.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.830
Let him...

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.090
What I mean is...

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:36.380
I should borrow more money for him

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:38.560
and collect more funds.

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:42.190
Don't do this to yourself.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.370
He made the mistakes.
Don't punish yourself over it.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.290
Does Yi Yi know about it?

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:49.710
She doesn't know.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.240
That's right.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.450
This is a Party matter,
and she's an outsider.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:55.800
I just want to tell you

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.590
not to bring these emotions home.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.190
Yi Yi is not Rumei.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:05.030
Someone like Yi Yi,
a petty-bourgeois intellectual,

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.590
is fragile and sensitive.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:09.580
She won't understand you.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:19.520
Then how about this, Minister Wen?

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:20.710
I'll go back

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.630
and ask Yan.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.730
See if he can also borrow some money

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.840
f-from his comrades-in-arms

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.040
to help Zhao Hangong.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:32.470
That would be wonderful.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.530
Thank you, Ms. Fang.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:36.130
And thank the Chief for me.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.550
Don't mention it.
