01:44.750 --> 01:47.167
I thought maybe you were hungry.

[Smee whispering] Hey!

02:31.333 --> 02:33.167
Hey, I hear you. I know you're in there.

02:34.083 --> 02:35.708
G… Go away, I'm busy!

02:35.792 --> 02:38.500
What are you… What are you talking about?
We're never busy.

02:44.458 --> 02:47.000
Shh. Shh. Shh. Keep your voice down!

02:47.083 --> 02:48.500
[Smee] You're being a shit.

02:49.167 --> 02:51.375
-[knocking on door]
-[Slightly] Please leave me alone, Smee.

02:51.458 --> 02:53.375
Leave me alone. Please!

02:53.458 --> 02:56.458
-Somebody's gonna hear you, Smee.
-[Smee] I don't-- Okay, I don't care.

02:56.542 --> 02:59.875
-Let me in. I know something's going on.
-[Slightly] You're gonna ruin everything.

02:59.958 --> 03:01.208
What are you talking about?

03:03.000 --> 03:06.250
-What?
-No. It's… Can I… Can…

03:09.875 --> 03:11.667
-Is somebody hiding?
-[creature gurgling]

03:13.917 --> 03:16.417
Is… It's-It's a per… It's a person.

03:17.042 --> 03:18.167
What did you do?

03:21.333 --> 03:22.667
[screams, panting]

03:26.583 --> 03:27.667
What did you do?

03:31.250 --> 03:32.333
Slightly!

03:33.833 --> 03:34.833
Slightly.

03:35.625 --> 03:38.250
Slightly… what… what… Hey, hey.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.417
[Slightly] You can't tell anybody.
Okay? Do you promise?

03:41.917 --> 03:46.000
'Cause if you do, that man from the ship,
he's gonna kill my family.

03:47.708 --> 03:49.917
Y-You did this to Arthur?

03:51.167 --> 03:52.250
You…

03:52.333 --> 03:55.042
You would have too if he had chosen you.

03:55.125 --> 03:59.333
Blackmail or whatever you call it.
Dead mother, dead brothers, dead everyone.

04:00.667 --> 04:01.917
Is he gonna be okay?

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
Like, it's not--
It's-It's not gonna kill him?

04:10.333 --> 04:11.500
-No.
-[Smee] Great.

04:12.167 --> 04:14.000
That's-That's-That's what the man said.

04:14.083 --> 04:15.917
He said he just needs the monster.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.375
Once he has it, he'll let Arthur go.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.583
Okay?

04:22.083 --> 04:25.167
I just… I just-just… I just need
to get him out of here.

04:25.250 --> 04:26.667
This is, uh…

04:27.750 --> 04:29.375
-To where?
-To the beach.

04:29.458 --> 04:30.542
Have to get him to the beach.

04:30.625 --> 04:32.000
Okay.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.167
Smee.

04:35.833 --> 04:36.833
Will you help me?

04:36.917 --> 04:39.000
-Please.
-No.

04:40.833 --> 04:42.333
-No.
-Please!

04:43.417 --> 04:44.708
Please.

04:46.333 --> 04:47.417
Please.

04:48.917 --> 04:50.292
Okay.

04:50.375 --> 04:52.083
-[Slightly] You will?
-Yeah.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.417
[Slightly] Thank you.

04:54.167 --> 04:56.333
Thank you. Thank you.
Please, grab his legs.

04:56.417 --> 04:57.792
Grab his legs!

04:57.875 --> 04:59.167
Come on, Smee.

05:01.458 --> 05:03.333
[pants] Just grab his legs.

05:09.917 --> 05:10.958
[chattering on radio]

05:18.750 --> 05:21.417
[Smee] Slightly,
corridor's empty. Let's go.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.542
[alarm blaring]

05:50.333 --> 05:51.375
[electricity hums, crackles]

05:52.792 --> 05:54.250
[clicks]

05:55.875 --> 05:58.458
[alarm stops, chimes]

06:11.250 --> 06:12.417
[guard 1] Clear.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.083
[electricity crackling]

06:27.125 --> 06:28.375
[guard 2] Clear, sir.

06:37.667 --> 06:38.750
Collect the hybrid.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.583
Put the fly back in its cage.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.708
Yes, sir.

06:43.208 --> 06:44.250
[sighs]

06:46.167 --> 06:47.750
You should be safe for now.

06:50.125 --> 06:52.333
Okay. What did we lose?

06:53.042 --> 06:54.833
One of the children got careless.

06:54.917 --> 06:56.333
Oh. Really, which one?

06:56.417 --> 06:58.958
I'll send him to bed without any supper.

07:00.750 --> 07:01.875
That one.

07:04.708 --> 07:05.792
Is that…

07:05.875 --> 07:06.875
Isaac.

07:09.250 --> 07:10.500
Tootles.

07:11.875 --> 07:13.542
The fly did this?

07:13.625 --> 07:17.333
Yes. They digest their food
outside their bodies.

07:19.125 --> 07:23.875
Organic matter must have been scarce in
their world, so they eat mostly minerals.

07:23.958 --> 07:27.125
Amazing.
Where are we on reboot and restore?

07:27.792 --> 07:29.875
Conceptually, it's possible.

07:29.958 --> 07:31.833
Practically, we haven't cracked it.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.000
There goes that six billion.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.833
-No more kids in the lab.
-Except Wendy.

07:37.917 --> 07:39.792
Yeah, of course,
but you need to watch her,

07:39.875 --> 07:43.708
-make sure there are no more accidents.
-This wasn't an accident, Isaac's death.

07:43.792 --> 07:46.750
-You just said…
-You need to watch the tape.

07:49.750 --> 07:50.750
[grunts]

08:05.458 --> 08:09.083
[scoffs] The calculation.
Knowing the consequences of his actions.

08:09.583 --> 08:11.750
Most animals know
cause and effect to some degree.

08:11.833 --> 08:14.667
[Boy Kavalier] Yeah, but the sheep
didn't benefit directly from his action,

08:14.750 --> 08:15.958
the fly did.

08:16.458 --> 08:17.500
So, why do it?

08:20.417 --> 08:21.708
I want him moved.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.750
-Precaution?
-Yeah, something like that.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.875
What's going on?

08:28.667 --> 08:29.833
Is…

08:32.542 --> 08:33.708
What is that?

08:34.375 --> 08:35.375
An accident.

08:35.958 --> 08:37.167
Yeah, horrible.

08:37.792 --> 08:42.167
Couldn't be avoided,
but it's… it's all contained now.

08:43.083 --> 08:45.250
"Contained." What happened?

08:46.667 --> 08:48.167
Wh-What happened to Isaac?

08:49.208 --> 08:50.583
Science.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.458
No, we… we can't. We're premium.

08:54.542 --> 08:55.625
Don't.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.875
I've got to tell the others.

09:03.958 --> 09:05.833
Hol… Hold on there.

09:05.917 --> 09:07.458
Let's think this through a minute.

09:07.542 --> 09:11.667
We don't wanna scare everyone, right?
You know, a freak accident like this.

09:11.750 --> 09:14.375
You know what kids are like
if they get an idea in their head.

09:14.458 --> 09:18.083
"Oh, my God, we're not safe." [chuckles]
And suddenly there's no talking to them.

09:18.583 --> 09:20.292
We're not safe?

09:21.333 --> 09:23.750
N… No, no, that's not what…

09:26.250 --> 09:27.333
Talk to her.

09:31.583 --> 09:34.625
[Wendy] Please get out of my way. [pants]

09:38.417 --> 09:40.000
[Wendy screeching]

09:49.333 --> 09:51.333
You can't just erase things.

09:54.708 --> 09:58.375
Oh, shit. Where are the others?
We've got to get to them before her.

10:01.208 --> 10:02.375
[punching keys]

10:03.375 --> 10:04.375
[beeps]

10:06.292 --> 10:08.292
-I don't know.
-What do you mean, you don't know?

10:08.375 --> 10:09.833
Someone turned their trackers off.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.500
Fuck!

10:12.875 --> 10:14.125
[smacks table]

10:23.917 --> 10:25.083
Marcy.

10:26.458 --> 10:27.458
Marce.

10:28.667 --> 10:29.792
He's dead.

10:31.875 --> 10:32.875
[Hermit] What?

10:34.792 --> 10:36.167
Isaac's dead.

10:38.958 --> 10:41.000
They said it was an accident.

10:46.375 --> 10:47.750
I am so sorry.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.208
We're not safe here. We have to go.

10:51.292 --> 10:54.500
-We can't. They track us.
-[Hermit] No, not anymore.

10:55.917 --> 10:57.000
Arthur.

10:57.542 --> 10:58.917
All of us?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.125
[Hermit] All of you.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.667
We have to get everybody.

11:05.958 --> 11:09.500
I don't know how much time we have
until they realize that something's wrong.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.042
We can't collect everyone.

11:11.125 --> 11:13.458
-I can't leave without…
-Marcy, we have to.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.583
Would you leave without me?

11:18.542 --> 11:20.250
No, of course not.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.083
Because you're my brother.

11:22.167 --> 11:23.208
Right.

11:24.542 --> 11:26.125
Then you get why I have to try.

11:29.292 --> 11:30.375
Okay.

11:31.708 --> 11:32.833
But fast.

11:38.667 --> 11:39.667
Nibs?

11:41.208 --> 11:42.417
What did you say to her?

11:42.500 --> 11:43.792
[Wendy] The truth, that's all.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.083
No, you freaked her out.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.250
Well, she should be freaked out.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.375
We should all be freaked out.
You know what they did to her.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.042
Yeah, they tried to help,
and you ruined it.

11:51.125 --> 11:53.750
-They erased her memories.
-[Nibs] No.

11:55.042 --> 11:56.458
I've got all my mind.

11:57.542 --> 11:58.583
What's in me.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.708
Nobody's messing with my insides.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.458
Isn't that right, Mr. Strawberry?

12:09.250 --> 12:11.333
What's ours is ours
and nobody can take it.

12:13.292 --> 12:14.708
Isaac's dead.

12:15.500 --> 12:18.625
We're not safe here.
I don't think we ever were.

12:18.708 --> 12:20.792
We were fine
until you made us get your brother.

12:20.875 --> 12:22.458
-It's not his fault!
-[Curly] No, I know that.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.708
It's yours.

12:24.375 --> 12:26.750
The boy genius is not your friend.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.583
-He owns us.
-Don't talk about him like you understand.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.125
He just wants to help people
like he helped us.

12:32.625 --> 12:35.208
[Nibs sniffles] We're all gonna die here.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.458
And then the bugs will crawl in,
and we'll all be ghosts.

12:39.542 --> 12:40.542
Nibs…

12:41.417 --> 12:43.083
I don't want to be a ghost.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.333
Okay, we have to go.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.833
This is the best place I've ever been.

12:51.458 --> 12:55.125
Promise me,
really promise you won't tell on us.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.958
Promise me, Curly.

13:00.583 --> 13:01.667
I promise.

13:04.792 --> 13:05.958
[Hermit] Marcy.

13:06.042 --> 13:07.125
[chattering on radio]

13:14.042 --> 13:16.167
-[door closes]
-[Hermit] We gotta go, Marcy.

13:20.583 --> 13:21.750
What are you doing?

13:37.667 --> 13:39.792
-[door opens]
-[alarm blaring]

13:39.875 --> 13:41.667
[alien screeching]

13:49.167 --> 13:50.417
[Wendy] Come on, Nibs.

13:51.417 --> 13:52.625
What did you do?

14:08.417 --> 14:10.333
[door opens]

14:11.125 --> 14:12.375
[Boy Kavalier] Where is he?

14:12.458 --> 14:13.917
-Who?
-[Boy Kavalier] The spouse.

14:15.792 --> 14:18.125
You fired him. He's on a transport.

14:18.208 --> 14:20.667
No, he isn't. He didn't get on the plane.

14:21.292 --> 14:23.792
What he did do was turn off
all their trackers. Was that the plan?

14:23.875 --> 14:26.292
Turn off their trackers
and smuggle my kids off the island?

14:26.375 --> 14:29.292
-He wouldn't.
-Why? Because he's a fucking saint?

14:30.333 --> 14:31.542
[Kirsh] The footage confirms it.

14:31.625 --> 14:34.667
Arthur and the brother turned off
the trackers a couple of hours ago.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.292
[Boy Kavalier] So you tell me
how you don't know anything about this.

14:41.167 --> 14:42.250
I don't.

14:45.458 --> 14:46.833
[alarm blaring]

14:46.917 --> 14:48.500
[computer] Secure lab breach.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.417
Secure lab breach.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.083
[Boy Kavalier] Be useful.

14:53.167 --> 14:54.208
[computer] Secure lab breach.

14:54.292 --> 14:55.417
Yes, sir.

14:55.917 --> 14:57.500
[computer] Secure lab breach.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.083
Secure lab breach.

15:01.833 --> 15:03.875

-Okay.
-[Smee] Wait, wait, wait.

15:14.667 --> 15:17.583
-[Slightly] Okay. This way.
-[Smee] Wait, no. Slightly!

15:17.667 --> 15:19.500
Slightly, stay, stay.

15:20.708 --> 15:22.292
-Yeah.
-[door opens]

15:24.875 --> 15:26.042
What are you doing?

15:26.917 --> 15:28.208
[Slightly] Um…

15:28.292 --> 15:29.292
[Kirsh] Well?

15:30.583 --> 15:32.042
[Slightly] The man from the ship.

15:32.875 --> 15:35.833
He's been… He's been talking
to me in my head.

15:36.542 --> 15:38.625
He asked me to bring Arthur to the beach.

15:39.208 --> 15:40.417
I know that.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.167
[exhales]

15:43.250 --> 15:45.625
I mean, what are you doing going that way?

15:46.250 --> 15:49.292
The quickest way to the beach
is to take the secure elevator.

15:52.792 --> 15:54.833
-[clicks]
-[elevator beeps]

15:58.125 --> 15:59.167
You're gonna be late.

That's my name.

17:17.625 --> 17:19.792
What I was called before.

17:36.667 --> 17:37.833
It's not us.

17:40.458 --> 17:41.583
We're still here.

[Smee] Why do you think
Kirsh didn't get us in trouble?

18:34.542 --> 18:36.292
[Slightly] I don't know. It's…

-Wait, wait, wait.

18:56.333 --> 18:57.500
They're gone.

18:58.208 --> 18:59.500
Wait. Wait.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Uh-oh.

Where… Where did we… Where did we put it?

19:05.625 --> 19:07.917
-It was… It was right here.
-Arthur.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
[Smee] No, no, no, no.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.292
-[Slightly] Arthur. Arthur.
-[Smee] Arthur! No.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.167
-No, no, no, no.
-Arthur.

19:14.125 --> 19:15.500
[Slightly] Arthur.

19:15.583 --> 19:16.667
I can't find him.

What is that?

19:30.625 --> 19:31.833
[Slightly] Uh…

19:33.042 --> 19:34.417
Where are we?

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
There was… There was a problem,
and we had to evacuate.

19:40.375 --> 19:41.583
A problem?

19:43.667 --> 19:46.333
Your wife's waiting for us
down at the beach.

19:46.417 --> 19:49.500
There was… It was just…
There-There was some kind of…

19:49.583 --> 19:50.583
[Slightly] "Contanimation."

19:50.667 --> 19:52.333
Yeah, contamination.

19:53.750 --> 19:54.833
[Slightly] Yeah.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.917
Yeah, and then we had… we had to evacuate.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.292
So, then we… we carried you.

20:01.875 --> 20:03.375
You had to carry me?

20:06.750 --> 20:08.417
W-Why? Did something happen?

20:10.917 --> 20:12.375
You don't remember?

20:13.625 --> 20:19.042
I remember Tootles
was missing, and… Hmm…

20:19.125 --> 20:21.333
-[Smee] Oh. The gas leak.
-[Slightly] Right.

20:21.417 --> 20:22.708
-The gas leak.
-The gas leak.

20:22.792 --> 20:24.917
-Yeah.
-Yeah, and then you breathed it.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.208
Yeah, like…

20:26.292 --> 20:29.333
And then
everyone went out ahead of us, and…

20:29.417 --> 20:31.417
now they're waiting for us at the beach.

20:35.792 --> 20:37.375
Confusion is a side effect of the gas.

20:38.750 --> 20:39.917
We'll help you.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.083
-[Arthur] Yeah, okay.
-Yeah.

20:42.625 --> 20:43.958
-Okay?
-[Arthur] Yeah.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.458
We had a… we had a fight,

20:50.125 --> 20:54.125
me and my Dame,
and then I was supposed to…

20:56.583 --> 20:59.292
I-I have to leave for a while.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.292
I don't want her last memory of me to be…

21:06.750 --> 21:08.083
I hope…

21:08.917 --> 21:10.625
I'm sorry.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.542
-Thank you.
-Oh.

21:13.625 --> 21:17.667
I… I think you maybe saved my life.

21:20.375 --> 21:21.583
You're welcome.

21:24.042 --> 21:25.208
Yeah, we should go.

We're almost there.

Whatever it is, you don't have to do it.

22:34.917 --> 22:37.625
Now, we need to go back
and we figure it out together.

22:38.750 --> 22:41.208
No, we're-we're just taking you
to your wife.

22:42.333 --> 22:43.500
[Arthur] Yeah.

22:43.583 --> 22:47.500
The thing is,
children have to learn how to lie.

22:48.833 --> 22:51.417
And you two are still learning.

22:55.042 --> 23:00.292
I-I don't know what's going on,
but I… I can tell you two are… are scared.

23:02.333 --> 23:03.708
I'm not scared.

23:05.958 --> 23:07.500
Now, see, that's the thing about lying.

23:07.583 --> 23:10.417
You-You do it once
and you gotta keep on lying.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.333
And you-you're lying to me
because you don't think I'll understand,

23:14.833 --> 23:19.583
but the thing is, you know,
us who-who love you, we will understand.

23:20.708 --> 23:23.125
So we're gonna… we're gonna go back…

23:25.042 --> 23:27.167
you're gonna tell me what's going on,

28:29.750 --> 28:33.417
I tried. I swear, I tried.

28:33.500 --> 28:36.250
I did everything you asked me to.

28:36.333 --> 28:39.500
If that were true, I wouldn't
be standing over a hollow corpse.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.000

Everything went wrong.

28:44.792 --> 28:45.917
I did what you said.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.292
I took him near the egg,
and the monster wrapped around his face.

28:48.375 --> 28:49.958
But then, I-I don't know.

28:50.042 --> 28:52.417
You didn't tell me that
there was going to be another monster.
