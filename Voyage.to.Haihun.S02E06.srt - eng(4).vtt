The more earnest your wish,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.150
the more gold you can earn.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.170
Go.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.720
Go.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.260
Gold.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.980
I want gold.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.080
The gold is mine.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.460
I want gold.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.740
Gold.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.850
I want gold.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.200
Gold.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.280
Gold.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.440
Gold.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.350
Hurry.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.680
Heng.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.940
Come.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.030
Come on, over here!

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.910
Quickly, quickly!

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.280
Lord Wang, Lord Wang!

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.390
Wang.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.000
You're awake.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.440
It hurts.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.120
Where does it hurt?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.210
My face hurts.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400
Be gentle.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.950
Sorry, I woke up grumpy.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.920
Help me up, give me a hand.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.760
Ah, alright.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.190
- Hey.
- How is he?

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.920
Lord Wang's pulse is steady.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.970
It's nothing serious now.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.270
Thanks, Uncle Li.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.280
I shall take my leave.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.120
Much obliged.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.360
Ouch.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.030
How could you risk yourself like that?

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.680
If Governor Sun
hadn't found you in time,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.110
the consequences could've been dire.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.010
What happened?

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.040
Something's wrong with the gold mine.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.740
When we found you,
you already passed out inside.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.710
Your eyes were closed,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.580
and there was a faint smile.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.540
I called you for ages,
but you didn't respond.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.300
That's terrifying.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.260
It really is.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.270
The smell...

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.240
Lord Wang.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.190
Are you alright?

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.870
Where are you going?

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.710
To the study.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.400
27 days.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.530
27 days, Wang Heng.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.040
Have you figured out fate?

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.260
You think you can control
all that's behind it.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120
But in the end,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.190
we are nothing but tiny pieces
on the board.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.120
Ha ha ha.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.630
Mandate of Heaven.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.160
Where lies the Mandate of Heaven?

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.600
It's but a wisp of fleeting light

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.510
that's gone in the blink of an eye.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.240
The rise and fall of fame and fortune

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.680
are but fleeting illusions.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.870
Gain and loss

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.370
are already destined.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.020
(Spirit Tablet of Wang Heng)

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.400
What are you doing?

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.830
Liu He, wake up.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:23.920
- Let go.
- Liu He.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.000
- Give it to me.
- It's me.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.240
Liu He, it's me. Liu He.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.290
Liu He.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:45.670
Here, take it.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.030
Yes, that's right.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.750
Where did this censer come from?

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.120
Li Zhong presented it to the Marquis.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.240
He claimed it could calm the mind
and relieve pain.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.080
Governor Sun.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.070
Yes, I'm here.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.840
Seize Li Zhong

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.400
at once.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.400
Yes.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
(Pharmacy)

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.800
Governor Sun.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:44.850
What's wrong?

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.710
Take him away.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.770
Why?

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.370
Governor Sun.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.310
Something's off
with the scent from the censer?

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.850
I smelled the same in the mine.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.440
When I was chasing the woman
from the Western Regions,

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.960
I smelled this very same scent,

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.960
which means she's come to Yuzhang.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.240
You mean the Marquis and the miners
were poisoned alike?

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.500
But this incense
only gives off a scent when lit.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.410
The incense in the Marquis's room
was used sparingly,

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.610
and the room
always aired out right after.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.520
That's why I failed to notice it.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.880
Yet even in small amounts,
it still took effect.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.620
It seems the Marquis has been
slowly poisoned for a long time.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.150
Lord Wang, Li Zhong has been arrested.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.380
(Governor's Mansion)

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.260
Li Zhong.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.370
Do you recognize this item?

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.320
Where did this bewitching incense
come from?

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.910
Do you know what harm it can cause?

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.510
Without smelling it,
the mind stays clear.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.600
Once inhaled, one falls under control

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.840
and begins to see illusions.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.540
Illusions lure out

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.960
the deepest desires of the heart.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.960
Since you know this,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.150
why hide it in the Marquis's study,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.240
harming the Marquis,

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.920
and then poison the mining area,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.270
bringing harm to the miners?

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:12.820
Li Zhong.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.640
You were once a man of virtue,

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.960
devoted to healing the world.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.750
Why commit such cruel deeds now?

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.960
Surely, someone sinister is behind this.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.570
If you reveal the true culprit,

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.120
I can spare your life.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.270
If you refuse,

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.030
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.960
Have you lost your tongue?

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.150
The antidote is ready

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.730
inside my medicine chest.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.150
- In the red bottle.
- Hurry.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.750
Once the Marquis takes it,
he'll be fine.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.320
Servants!

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.370
Take this to the Marquis.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.500
- As fast as you can.
- Yes.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.380
Wait.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.960
Do you know if this antidote...

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.840
It's genuine.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:07.630
I trust Uncle Li.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.660
Go.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.360
Since you had the antidote ready,

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.260
it shows this was never your intent.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.700
Why work for others' schemes?

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.680
Uncle Li.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.720
Why did you do such a thing?

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.150
Do you know

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.790
where my son Li Qi

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.160
is right now?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.800
Guards!

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.940
Li Zhong, you poisoned the Marquis

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.960
and harmed the miners.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.520
Take him away.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.840
Yes.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.530
Move.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.000
Marquis, slow down.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.370
Slow down.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.720
Wang.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.950
Are you feeling better?

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.320
Not your concern.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.220
Marquis.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.000
Wang has been running all over for you.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:18.150
I never asked him to.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.440
Nor did I ask for his help.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.380
Marquis.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.980
These past years, he's been busy.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.670
Most of it wasn't even for me.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.270
He doesn't really care for me.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.680
Isn't that right?

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.240
Lord Wang.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.840
Your lingering illness

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.150
is worse than your usual attacks.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.030
Wang, the Marquis speaks bluntly.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.120
Please don't take offense.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.900
Feel free to be offended.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.040
I'm just a fallen marquis.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.600
How could I compare to His Majesty?

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.630
I can't promise you power and wealth.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.390
Wang.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.870
Don't get physical.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.630
The Marquis just recovered.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.110
He may still be unclear-headed.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.840
All your talk
circles back to the Emperor.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.350
What now?

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:09.840
Do you want the throne?

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.360
Whoever wants it can have it.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.020
I don't care for it.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.240
What do you care for?

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.130
I know what you care for.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.480
Qingge gave this to me,

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.160
saying you forced it into her hands.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.010
Now, I'm returning it to you.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.750
Shall I tell you the spell as well?

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.840
Then you could go home.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.720
You're that kind?

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.500
Yeah.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.150
If you were, you'd have said so earlier.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.570
Now, only half remains.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.200
Take care of him.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.560
- You...
- The Marquis acts on impulse.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.080
Why follow along?

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.020
He's asked me to leave.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.900
Why should I stay here?

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.200
You're truly leaving?

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.470
Of course.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.830
I have my pride.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.720
Goodbye then.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.170
Goodbye.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.440
Why not try to keep me a bit longer?

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.540
I told you His Majesty's secret agents
seized the letters.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.600
Just admit it.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.200
You avoided me for power and wealth.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.870
You want to get beaten?

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.900
You beat me before anyway.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.330
So, no more fighting between you two?

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.200
- No more.
- No more.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.030
No more arguing, either?

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.870
Of course.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:23.920
No more...

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.830
Qingge.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.870
We're not children anymore.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:28.760
Don't worry.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.390
Alright, you're not.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.080
Wang.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.310
Thanks for your patience.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.550
You're still alive.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.760
I'm truly glad.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.910
You've recovered.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.480
I'm glad, too.
