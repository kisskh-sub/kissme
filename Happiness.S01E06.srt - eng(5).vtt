[This drama is a work of fiction. The characters, locations, agencies, religion, incidents, groups, and occupations have no connection to real entities.]

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.780
There was a 50% off sale sign in front of the store.
[Six months ago]

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.300
It's perfect for our baby,so I bought one.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.340
But we don't even know if it's a boy or a girl yet.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.430
It's a girl who resembles you. I say that every day while tapping on my tummy.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.850
A girl shouldn't look like me.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.590
The chairman must be here.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.390
Yes, I'm nearby, too.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.750
- See you later.
- Bye.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.360
Yes.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.760
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.530
Oh, so the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety gave the final approval?

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.320
Yes, yes, we will announce it tomorrow morning.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.350
It's only for adults with ADHD, and if it's proven effective, we will add more patient categories.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.530
Good work. I was getting concerned, wondering if I have to take all those Next pills piled in the warehouse.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.700
Thanks to you, I will be making money again, Director Han.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.070
It failed as a treatment for pneumonia, but I believe it's plausible for adult ADHD.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.820
Yes, yes. The word is already out that it increases the ability to concentrate.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.090
Quite a few people around me are already taking it.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.860
- Is it Next?
- Yes.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.260
- Have you not tried it, Director Han?
- No.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.150
Try taking it when you're feeling tired. I feel alive. It's excellent.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.890
Hello.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.140
Hello, I'm Park Young In.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.390
I heard a lot about you. Please take a seat.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.880
- Is that it?
- Yes.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.790
So are you having a prince or a princess?

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.460
Our baby? I think it's a girl.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.630
Aigoo. That's great. They say having one daughter is better than ten sons these days.
[Clinic]

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.830
That's what everyone says.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.160
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.410
Then when do we get to meet your princess?

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.230
I'm at twelve weeks right now so probably in about six months?

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.040
Biting people?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.390
Are you sure they didn't take some other drugs?

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.360
We are announcing the final approval tomorrow.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.210
Check him into the hospital and make sure no one talks. The rumor can't get out.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.040
It's not like they died. Who cares? Just offer treatment cost and compensation then!

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.080
I'll call you back.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.390
Honey...

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.420
The prime minister's office is summoning you.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.410
Where is it going?

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.080
The landfill. We lack facilities for mild case patients.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.490
Do you still not understand what I'm doing?

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.920
No, Sir.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.040
I made the choice, at which point I'll prevent further damage.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.770
You'll soon have to decide how far you'll get your hands bloodied, Lieutenant Lee.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.460
How did the treatment drug work?

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.890
We sorted biotherapeutics and injected them into the infected, but they all died.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.650
Do it again. Until it works. I'll buy us time.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:06:00.060
[Happiness]

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.300
[Episode 6]

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.380
What do we do then?

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.260
You're saying Madman Rabies patients are right outside, but we won't be getting help from the authorities.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.390
We have to force our way out then!

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.250
They even installed fences along the walls.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.870
Even if we make it out, where are we supposed to go?

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.790
We just have to get out first and go into the most expensive apartment.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.820
What can they do then? Will they lock that down too? With a bunch of high and mighty people living there?

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.690
The reason they're doing this to us is that our apartments are cheap.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.400
But are you sure the patients are outside?

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.030
Building Representative and Oh Joo Hyung are both absent.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.310
Are you implying that it's just the renters that are here again?

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:50.080
I'm trying to say that most of the people who left the building are absent.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.700
If you want to go outside, go ahead.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.970
I can't guarantee that you'll make it back, though.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.820
Then I'll assume that all of you understand.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:06.380
The food and other items we brought from the supermarket are in unit 201. Go there if you need anything.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:12.930
But I'm sure they are lacking something, too, so please exchange it for whatever they need.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.960
If the infected people's symptoms get worse, what if they break in through the doors?

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.430
If they hit it with a car or something, it'll break since it's a glass door.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.590
They'll probably find an easier way to get inside instead.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.060
That's how a crime always starts out.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.790
"I went in because the door was left open, I took the bike because there was no lock on it..."

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.950
But "I want to break in because I'm craving blood"...

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.470
To come to that decision is tougher than you think.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.220
It means, as long as you don't give them a reason to...

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.050
All the doors have been locked...

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.820
Why?

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.460
The rooftop.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.490
I'm the only one here.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.190
Do you think he heard us?

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.390
I hope not.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.890
Andrew, you never get startled. Outside or here.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:53.650
I'm just happy that people don't see me as weird.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.530
Be careful, both of you.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.600
You, too, Andrew.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.900
Let's take a breather before we go back in.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.200
I'm so tired.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.130
This reminds me of the old days, standing here like this.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.760
When?

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.940
That day? Hey.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.430
Gosh, I wondered momentarily if I could fly that day.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.300
You did fly.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.260
I did.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.790
If I could fly, I would go to my mom's nursing home.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:53.170
It was uncomfortable to go see her so I kept postponing it, and here we are.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.830
I wonder what happened to all the infected people.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:04.030
Are they hiding somewhere and holding back their thirst?

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.120
They're probably scared.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.630
Afraid that they'll bite someone closest to them. Afraid that they'll completely turn into monsters.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:17.730
But I'm sure they'll fight until they're defeated by their thirst.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.060
Everyone should be okay, right?

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:26.040
Of course. We just have to make sure not to get hurt so we can meet them again healthy.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.960
So don't do that kind of stuff ever again.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.550
Hey! We have no idea what kind of blood that is. Why would you get it on your hands?

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.540
But it's okay that I put it on Oh Joo Hyung's face?

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.270
Well, it's not like you made him eat it.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.800
I doubt he would lick that blood.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.300
He would never do that.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.290
Gosh, it seemed like he really cares about his health.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:53.580
Seeing that he didn't come down earlier, I think he feels a bit intimidated now.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.280
Now that I think about it, the Building Rep didn't show up, either, right?

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.640
Are you okay?

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.650
Of course, I'm not okay.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.870
Look at this.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:29.220
I must've been so shocked for this to happen... Darn.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.000
Maybe it's best to give up, given what happened.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.500
Looking at the state of things, it doesn't seem like you would make that much money by being the resident representative.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.780
And if we move? If we move now, this place would be worth nothing. Dirt cheap.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.880
So you want us to lose money by leaving here and starting over at another apartment?

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.350
I'm saying it because there's no other way.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.090
You said you think Seung Beom at the gym seems infected, too.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.300
You went to the gym every day. What did you do there?

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.820
You should have monitored stuff like that.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.620
I had no idea he would do that.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:09.780
When the lockdown is lifted, the entire apartment complex will need some repair.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:15.560
I'll change the elevator's interior, and I'll suggest getting rid of the outer wall.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.500
The lockdown was easier because of that wall.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.710
Let's also suggest that we plant some trees around the perimeter.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.950
You said you know a landscaping company, right?

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:29.630
We can sterilize the whole place since there were infected people.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.770
That's right! That's it!

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:39.230
Once we think differently, there are plenty of ideas.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:45.410
But do you think you can become the resident's representative?

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.820
I'll recruit some people who are influential in the building.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.070
My father was a schizophrenic.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.860
He passed away two years ago.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:02.770
I get shocked easily if I see a similar type of illness.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.410
Unni isn't home right now.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.330
Darn it.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.520
I see. You're the child from unit 502.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.510
So are you home alone?

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.950
Where are the people from unit 501?

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.840
- Can you open the door for a second?
- The people from Unit 501 are here.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.760
That scared me.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.430
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:43.060
But you know, you should have explained properly that you're fine.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.410
Anyone would misunderstand seeing the blood.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.650
Don't you think so?

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.860
It's tough for you, too, isn't it?

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.050
But what a relief that there is someone taking care of you.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.090
It is a huge relief.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.890
That we are on the lower floors.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.480
With all this going on, you must be so disappointed that you can't enjoy being newlyweds.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.760
My husband and I started on the first floor of a villa.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.290
And of all days, there was a flood.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.090
When I think back to how much we suffered...

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.750
How did you two meet?

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.370
Oh, my goodness.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.370
You two must go back pretty far.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.990
Please have a seat over there.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.590
- I can't trust that ahjumma.
- Me, neither.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.900
So why did you bring her in?

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.130
"Keep your friends close, your enemies closer."

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.040
Hey, where is Sae Bom?

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.080
She's talking to the building representative. She says she came by to apologize.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.540
Apologize?

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.420
- I'm sure even her apology makes you feel angry.
- Yeah!

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.830
It's because she's not sorry.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:25.630
But she asked me if I was aiming to become the resident's representative.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.430
- So that's what she's after.
- Why would you want to? It'd be such a hassle.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.130
She spoke like you would make tons of money.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.630

To look for leftover pills. It helps me focus better when I take it.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.130
While all this is going on, you were thinking about taking pills?

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.560
I really only took it twice.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.380
Can you remember the moment symptoms surface?

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.820
A little... a little bit.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:56.490
The ahjussi from the sixth floor said something to me

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.690
so I tried to hold back.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:05.740
- But he kept saying stuff, so—
- I suggest you hold yourself back more from now on.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.160
The more often you turn,

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:15.030
the harder it'll be to get back to yourself.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.840
I told that ahjussi about the drug earlier.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.230
That it's inside the gym car.

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.200
I'll take care of that.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.930
Were you happy?

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.130
Do you feel happy when you're having an episode?

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:43.920
Does it feel exciting and exhilarating?

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.380
I guess he won't be able to hold himself back too long.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.320
It's cold outside, wear something warm.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.330
How is the gym guy doing?

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.880
He's back to normal.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.710
He turns for about 15 minutes and then goes back to normal.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.560
We'll be voting tomorrow.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.510
On what?

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:26.760
Whether we should kick Kim Seung Beom out or not.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.750
The sixth-floor lawyer said we are a democratic nation so we should vote on the decision.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:37.270
To be honest, I thought I had a bad temper,

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.890
but I'm nothing compared to the people here.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.580
Didn't the building representative say anything?

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.290
She only cares about being the resident's representative.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:50.650
She said she'll remove our maintenance fees later if we work with her.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.250
Jung Gook was right.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.870
But...

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:03.070
What Oh Joo Hyung said isn't true, right?

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.510
What?

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:08.920
That I tried to kill him? That's not true. That bastard...

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.370
He threatened Kim Seung Beom first so I scared him a little. That's all.

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:13.890
- Right?
- Of course.

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:15.140
It worried me a little.

00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.870
You know, I'm not good at keeping things to myself.

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:20.370
I'm aware.

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:21.960
Bom.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.410
- There's something called a good cop, bad cop strategy.
- Yes?

00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:28.680
When one plays the bad cop

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.390
and gets angry and scares people,

00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:33.690
the good cop speaks nicely and persuades them.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.040
Carrot and a whip.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.620
- So?
- I'll play the bad cop so you'll have to be the good cop.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.350
- I don't want to.
- What?

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.200
You've played the bad cop numerous times. It's my turn.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:51.150
I'll beat up anyone who annoys me.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:55.400
So just be nice. Okay?

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:59.730
- Be nice.
- Hey...

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:02.170
♫ But myself against the world ♫

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.110
It's because I don't want you to get hurt.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:10.110
Usually, bad cops get hurt.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.450
We have to release him. That's the only way we can survive.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.770
We have to release him. That's the only way we can survive.

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:17.760
Are the rest of the people here okay?

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.040
Has anyone gotten bit?

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.080
I'm not sure yet, but as soon as they show symptoms, we need them off the premises.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.000
Sir.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.130
Could you send this video to me?

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:29.570
Do you agree that we should remove him?

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.670
Of course! I saw all the infected people outside!

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.770
- Aigoo.
- I was watching that. Why did you take it like that?

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:38.480
I ask for your cooperation.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.650
The situation is rather serious, don't you think?

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:43.950
Yes, yes. I got scared because I saw something like this!

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.820
Now you understand why I act that way, right?

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:48.330
Is that important right now?

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.020
Hey, look at his eyes.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:55.290
Is Oh Joo Hyung inside?

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.380
He seems to keep washing.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:05.950
If you prefer, we have a spare room

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.230
so you're welcome to stay with us.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:17.160
Thank you for caring.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.890
Do you have to go this far?

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:37.070
Of course. Imagine if I opened the door earlier. I would have been

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.680
killed by that bastard instantly.

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:44.620
He was trying to kill me by talking about the gravesite!

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.380
What if we become affected, too?

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.550
Why would we? We didn't do anything bad.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:55.400
You don't have to do something bad to get infected.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.350
Anyway, I'm not coming outside until the lockdown is lifted.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:17.770
It'll only take five minutes. Five minutes is enough to save someone's life.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.580
Are you sure they're human?

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.620
I'm talking about the Madman Rabies patient.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:27.200
Of course! If you go down to the gym, you can even talk to him!

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.050
By you refusing to leave your house,

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:32.840
a person may lose their life...

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.790
Please think about it carefully.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.810
Please think about it carefully.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:52.600
[Le Ciel. 1501]

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.240
What are you doing over here?

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.340
I was just waiting for you. Where did you go?

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.410
To the 15th floor. I asked him to come and vote tomorrow.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:30.470
Have you ever had any regrets in life?

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.180
I have.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:44.500
When something happens, and it's over before I could do my best,

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.420
it really makes me regret it.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:52.100
Even after time passes, it stays with me and makes me feel uncomfortable.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.170
So, you don't want to regret anything this time?

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:57.720
Yes.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:03.390
This time around, I'm not going to avoid it.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:18.910
Bingo.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:23.930
Oh?

[D-4]

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.470
Let's go!

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.700
Mom, let me borrow your phone.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.080
Why?

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.270
I'll give it back after recording a video.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:50.750
I lost mine.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.410
Where did you lose your phone?

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:56.530
Wasn't it a new phone?

00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:00.550
Mom, you only use it for calling, right?

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:02.390
Your password. Oh, it's open.

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:03.760
Thank you.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.930
Hey, give it back after you're done recording.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:09.400
All right!

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.310
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:16.230
Thank you for making time to come.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:22.420
Under Article 22 of the Criminal Code, there's a law about Emergency Evacuation.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.080
I'll read it to you.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.740
"An act to avoid the current danger to one's own or another's legal interests"

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.830
"shall not be punished when there is a good reason."

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.470
"The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not apply to"

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:36.730
"a person who is responsible for not avoiding danger."

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:41.100
To put it simply, for us to survive,

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.610
it's okay to throw out the infected.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:49.490
I'm sure none of you want to catch the disease and go crazy like other building people.

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:50.950
Right?

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:53.750
I'll show you this once.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:57.350
It's frightening. Look.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.390
My Lord...

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:04.350
Has anyone here caught Covid?

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:06.150
Why are you bringing up Covid all of a sudden?

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:07.780
No one?

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.040
I did... catch it...

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.650
Then let me ask you.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.140
Sir.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:18.120
Did you catch Covid because you did something wrong?

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.190
What are you talking about?

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:25.300
What did I do wrong? If only those old fogies didn't ask me out to lunch.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.500
Why did I go there?

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.830
Exactly.

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:33.200
The disease doesn't select people to infect.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.270
You remember during Covid, right?

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:40.180
When someone caught it, some people revealed their identity and blamed them,

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.830
but most people worried about them

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:46.730
and wished for their recovery.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:52.060
That's not something you should get thrown out for without treatment.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:56.100
Well, how is this the same as Covid?

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.020
It is different.

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:06.410
It makes them attack and bite people. I get that everyone is afraid and anxious. I feel the same way.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:10.560
But what will happen if it happens

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.520
to me or my family?

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:19.310
After we throw out trainer Kim Seung Beom, who is next?

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.320
Oh Joo Hyung on the sixth floor?

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.200
Or the attorney who came in contact with Oh Joo Hyung?

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:30.500
Should we play musical chairs until only one person remains?

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.770
That's enough. Let's vote.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:35.760
Who agrees that we should throw him out?

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:43.800
We don't necessarily have to throw him outside.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.040
I'm just saying let's not have him mingle with the uninfected.

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:51.330
If we lock him up on the rooftop or something and keep us separated, we'll all be safe.

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:53.410
Don't you agree?

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:57.790
Just be yourself and raise your hand comfortably. Why be timid in this day and age?

00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:59.790
Hurry and raise your hand.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:02.030
Go ahead.

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:08.340
Raise your hand. Hurry, hurry.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:17.160
Ahjumma! How can you do that to me?

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.150
You're the one who brought me here!

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:23.170
I guess he feels betrayed since I treated him well all this time.

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:27.430
A total of eight people.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:30.650
So Yoon, what are you doing? Raise your hand.

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.270
Hey!

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.400
Nine.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.770
Those who oppose?

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:56.260
One, two,

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.470
three,

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:00.160
four...

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:04.970
five, six...

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.510
six...

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:10.540
seven,

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.980
eight,

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:18.810
nine.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.890
We are tied. What should we do?

I don't think we need to.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.610

Ten votes. It's done.

All right then. Let's discuss how we'll monitor Kim Seung Beom.

It's too tough for my husband and me to monitor him along with Detectim Kim Jung Gook.

What's going on?

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.400
I heard you suggested to the prime minister's office

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.210
to control access to the areas with lots of infected people.

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:38.170
I told them that we cannot stop the infection once the number of infected starts to increase.

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:42.920
True. We don't have a cure.

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:50.960
All we can do is maintain a low temperature and stall time with tranquilizers and sleeping pills.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.930
Chairman, you don't have much time left, either, right?

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:56.820
Maximum a month?

Your wife is the same, right?

She got infected right around the same time as me.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:06.890
I thought that's why you said you would develop a cure within a month.

I know very well how rushed you must feel, Chairman.

I'm giving up on all the quarantined areas.

You barely supported us all this time.

As you mentioned, we can't have more infected people.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:42.990
Let's shut off electricity, and don't pass out food.

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:48.530
The ACs are on throughout the country. No need to waste energy.

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:54.360
Shut off the electricity and wait for the infected to die on their own?

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.720
Even with a cure, there will be problems.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:03.240
We can't go easy on those who have tasted human blood already, just because it happened while they were sick.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:07.880
But, Sir, you're one of those who are addicted to the taste of blood.

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.250
It's okay for me.

I'm telling you this so you know it in advance.

If the electricity is shut off, the water will be shut off, too.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.960

You and I can think differently.

I still don't think I was wrong about it.

So if we catch the disease, would you be accountable?

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:05.550
This is why I shouldn't have married an uneducated person.

You dropped it on our way in. Right in front of the building.

I'm sorry.

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:31.420
Let's not speak too crudely.

00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:35.150
We are still family.

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:37.750
Family, my foot.

00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:50.670
It's safe here. Right?

00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:51.630
Where are you going?

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:54.980
What? I hear some noise.

00:58:56.130 --> 00:58:59.040
Hey, it's okay. It's safe here.

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.270
Hey! Come here!

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:19.460
What's with you two?

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:21.140
Hey! Hey!

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.300
Run away!

00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:42.850
I don't think anyone is there.

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:49.120
Hey, don't open it.

00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:54.670
You always say "hey" to me. I'm your oppa.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.190
Did you get scared?

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:13.400
Hey, don't worry. Your oppa is here.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.060
Is something going on out there?

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.210
No...

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:15.090
Sae Bom! Yoon Sae Bom!

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.650
Sae Bom is here, right?

01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:26.220
She's busy right now.

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.100
She'll be right out. Wait just a moment.

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:36.220
Did you take the drug? The one you bought at the gym?

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:47.440
If you laid even a finger on Sae Bom, you're dead.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:56.070

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:14.700
A person is missing because of you.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.200
We have the power, but we need a person.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.080
Someone who will do what we tell him to.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.040
It's not as if my thirst is quenched when I drink water.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.110
It's Na Soo Min's phone.

01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:28.790
The electricity in your building will be shut off tonight.

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:30.810
Hyung, you guard here.

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.400
I'm here to take Sae Bom.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.580
I came here to find even a small possibility.

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:38.860
Even if we have to get her bit by an infected, if necessary.
