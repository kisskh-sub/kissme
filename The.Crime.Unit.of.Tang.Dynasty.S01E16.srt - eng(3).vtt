WEBVTT

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:20.625
Hey, Old Master.

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:23.750
Was it you who blew the horn just now?

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:26.291
Then why did those two react to the horn?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.750
Kind words can't save a darned soul.

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:31.250
You were lucky to survive this time.

00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:36.750
Didn't we risk ourselves to save you?

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.916
Troublemaker, give it back!

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.458
You tricked us into looking for your grandfather, didn't you?

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:53.333
Speak.

00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:54.583
Let go.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:58.625
Grandpa.

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:03.666
Dogwa, go to bed.

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:04.833
Go.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.875
Old Master.

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:12.208
Why did those two villagers turn into monsters?

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.083
What do you know about this?

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:19.333
We can't leave until we find who we're looking for.

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:20.750
We're not leaving.

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:26.250
They've all caught an affliction.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.625
When it strikes, they become like beasts.

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:31.416
Dogwa, this child...

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:33.541
He grew up among sheep.

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:36.958
Instead of feeding them sheep,

00:02:37.416 --> 00:02:42.125
it might be better to feed them with you.

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:44.708
The disease turns them into monsters.

00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:49.416
When will they change?

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.125
How many change at once?

00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:53.583
It's never certain.

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.208
What exactly is this disease?

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:57.375
What have they been through?

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:06.916
You ask too many questions.

00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:09.541
This is not the place for answers.

00:03:09.708 --> 00:03:12.333
Thinking too much won't keep you alive.

00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:14.916
Old Master.

00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:00.083
Take this.

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:03.916
Remember, human life matters more than a sheep's.

00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:05.250
Understand?

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:18.083
Hey, look.

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.750
There shouldn't be anything this valuable here.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.625
Where did this come from?

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:26.625
I found it, I swear.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:27.625
Let me see.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.708
Where did you find it?

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:36.583
At...

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:38.416
At...

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.166
Still awake.

00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:04.083
Your affliction is getting harder to control.

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:05.791
Your sheep reek.

00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:07.583
Grass-fed beasts.

00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:09.958
Not enough blood scent.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.416
Remember, you're human.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.541
Not a beast.

00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:14.166
Where's Guo Huai?

00:05:14.458 --> 00:05:15.625
If he were here...

00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:16.875
Would you dare talk like that?

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:17.750
You...

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.375
You've grown old.

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:22.250
Those chains you used to bind us,

00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:24.208
have aged with you.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.333
Shut your mouth!

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:26.791
Guo Huai isn't here.

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:28.291
Are you trying to cause trouble?

00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:30.750
Hellâ€™s gate is shut,

00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:32.625
yet they force their way in.

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.291
It's fate.

00:05:34.708 --> 00:05:38.125
Those people yesterday seemed like government lackeys.

00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:39.458
You dare act recklessly?

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:42.916
I wouldn't dare.

00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:45.041
If Brother Guo Huai finds out,

00:05:45.291 --> 00:05:47.166
he'll kill me on the spot.

00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:50.708
You'd better behave.

00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:10.833
The princess is likely nearby.

00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:13.250
We have to keep searching.

00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:15.875
But out there, you can't tell people from monsters.

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:19.291
A princess of the realm vanished on the road.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.416
I've received strict orders from above.

00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:23.541
We must find the princess.

00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:27.291
If anything happens to her,

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:28.791
if she's already dead...

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:31.000
We need her alive or her body.

00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:32.666
Imperial orders.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.125
Let's go.

00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:41.291
You still dare go out?

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.625
Gouwa.

00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:53.875
We're running out of mutton.

00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:05.375
Excuse me, may I ask...

00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:07.375
Have you seen its owner?

00:07:07.416 --> 00:07:08.583
It's a woman.

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:11.625
A woman?

00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:13.833
Women here

00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:15.791
are scornfully called "two-legged lambs."

00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.083
There's a cave east of the village.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.625
You've seen her?

00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:29.000
Yes.

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:30.083
Thanks.

00:08:05.416 --> 00:08:06.625
What's wrong?

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:11.583
Let's go.

00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:31.666
Kid, why are you here?

00:08:32.416 --> 00:08:34.041
The lamb is gone.

00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:44.416
Do you know where this is?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.250
Speak honestly.

00:08:51.125 --> 00:08:52.083
Ghost.

00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:53.833
Ghosts live here.

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:55.375
Ghost.

00:08:56.291 --> 00:08:58.000
Are the ghosts villagers who changed?

00:08:58.291 --> 00:08:59.666
Or were there ghosts here all along?

00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:08.833
Frontier garrison's setup.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.583
Looks like it's a military saber.

00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:26.958
Princess.

00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:29.916
Something's off.

00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:47.791
What are you trying to do?

00:09:57.708 --> 00:09:59.208
You beast!

00:10:04.666 --> 00:10:07.083
Battlefield ghosts never claim lives.

00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.166
That saying might not hold true today.
