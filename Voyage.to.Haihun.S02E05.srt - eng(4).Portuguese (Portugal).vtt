=Episode 5=

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.910
Liu He.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.310
Why are you eating the melon I bit?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.840
Gross.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.350
Marquis.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.870
Slow down; don't trip.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.400
Go away; that's gross.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.240
- Hey.
- I...

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.590
You've finished?

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.880
Do you have to follow me?

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.380
I'll go wherever you go.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.440
Even to the latrine.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.430
(I dined with him.)

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.930
(The food was fine.)

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.800
(I was overthinking.)

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.800
(Seems Liu He has gone mad,)

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.860
(just as the records say.)

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.150
(A bout of intermittent madness)

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.720
(brought on by great highs and lows.)

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.290
(I can only spend more time with him.)

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.820
(Haihun Marquis's Mansion)

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.400
Marquis.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.120
Asleep.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.800
You won't sleep without me, huh?

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.560
Liu He, Liu He.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.480
Imperial Guard Commander,
what do you want?

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.510
What's wrong with you?

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.790
A bout of intermittent madness?

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.910
Wait a moment.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.920
Stop beating around the bush.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.280
Well...

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.810
My room

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.950
is a bit

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.150
cold.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.190
This humble residence

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.750
is naturally small and chilly.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.270
The Emperor's place is warmer.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.400
Go stay with him.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.310
Hey.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.880
Ah.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.240
I'm cold.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.480
I'm freezing, truly freezing.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.040
Listen to me.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.240
I think

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.800
the South should have heating.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.380
Heating.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.700
Hey.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.980
(Spirit Tablet of Li Qi)

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.260
(Spirit Tablet of Liu He)

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.620
(Spirit Tablet of Wang Heng)

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.510
Did I say you could come in?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.270
It's been 11 years.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.070
It's been 11 years since they died.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.490
I thought you died, too.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.170
I woke from dreams in countless nights,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.680
seeing your faces drenched in blood.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.110
Wang Heng.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.750
It's been 11 years.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.830
Not a single word from you to me.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.860
(Spirit Tablet of Wang Heng)

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.950
Now, you stand before me.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.510
Am I to feel overjoyed

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.780
or offer gratitude to you,
Imperial Guard Commander?

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.660
(Spirit Tablet of Wang Heng)

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.430
I'm going to sleep now.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.960
Time to sleep.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.310
Sleep.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.750
I wrote you so many letters.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.070
So many letters.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.040
But His Majesty intercepted them.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.590
Sleep.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.440
Time to sleep.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.510
Sleep.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.620
This time, I've come back

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.880
only to keep you safe.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.600
Just like before.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.320
Lord Wang.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.640
Marquis.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.000
Time for your medicine.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.590
Medicine.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.000
Lord Wang.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.960
I'll stay and look after him.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.670
Duke.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.800
Lord Gong arranged all these classics.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.950
In Chang'an, you must study them often.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:42.800
Alright.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.640
Duke.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.040
Lord Gong forbids taking wine
to Chang'an.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.680
However,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.330
I hid two jars in secret.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.220
I'll fetch them now.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.560
Ha ha ha!

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.480
Duke.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.000
Bushi.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.750
Bushi... Bushi.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.880
Duke.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.360
Zhang Sheng.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.190
Why did you kill Bushi?

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.030
It wasn't me.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.330
It was you.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.420
If you don't believe me, look.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.310
Duke.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.400
It was Huo Guang.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.320
I didn't kill anyone.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.170
You love wine.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.360
You killed Bushi.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.440
Is this enough?

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.520
- Duke.
- Marquis.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.160
Li Qi.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.440
Marquis.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.680
Don't be afraid.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.200
You're dreaming.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.690
Get back to bed and sleep.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.080
Li Qi, tell Zhang Sheng.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.320
I didn't kill anyone.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.710
- I...
- Marquis.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:52.750
This isn't your fault.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.910
- It's all in the past.
- Li Qi.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.200
- It's over.
- Li Qi.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.740
Say something, Li Qi.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.600
Liu He.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.390
You don't believe me either, Li Qi?

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.860
(Yuzhang)

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.030
Ha ha ha.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.960
No need for such formality so early.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.120
Stay away from me.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.440
Were you alright last night?

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.220
Don't tell me you remember nothing.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.510
You laughed and then cried
at your reflection.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.870
No matter how I called,
you stayed silent.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.640
You don't know any of that?

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.680
I'm hideous.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.580
Don't sleep here.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.400
You might get startled.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.410
Out.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.140
Get out.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.080
Fine.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.000
Out!

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.840
Alright, alright.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:38.860
Leave us.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.420
The Marquis isn't sleepwalking.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.250
He was not asleep.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.730
He'd been speaking to an illusion.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:47.780
It's a hallucination.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.090
Hallucination?

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.460
That means visions in one's mind.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.670
Most likely caused by poison.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.190
But we eat and live with the Marquis.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.000
Why aren't we poisoned?

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.740
We must have missed something.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.910
Could it be Li Zhong?

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.840
(Haihun Marquis's Mansion)
Uncle Li.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.120
Lord Wang.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.200
What a coincidence.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.800
Are you delivering medicine?

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:22.900
Yes, Lord Wang.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.970
Let me deliver it for you.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.790
- No need.
- It's fine.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.630
It's nothing.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.380
Lord Wang, that's not proper.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.400
- This...
- Thanks.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.460
Lord Wang.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.870
Please spit it out.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.780
Come on, spit it out.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.920
The illusion...

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.480
When will it start?

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.800
So frightening.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.330
You saw right; it's me.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.280
Oh, my.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.000
Why is the effect so slow?

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.360
Forget about the effect.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.640
Look at this.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.870
This is Li Zhong's prescription?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.920
Yeah.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.200
When Li Zhong was out,
I had his pharmacy searched

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.080
and found this.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.270
I asked someone.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:34.440
It's just some

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.270
mind-calming medicine.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.790
You were sleeping so soundly.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.550
That must be the medicine working.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:40.660
Heavens.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.830
What sort of sleeping medicine
works so well?

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.230
Sleeping medicine?

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.450
It's the mind-calming medicine.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.390
Seems this has nothing to do
with Li Zhong's decoction.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.010
We need another way.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.080
But the Marquis often stays home

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.450
and rarely goes anywhere else.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.660
Could it be the mausoleum?

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.390
He doesn't allow outsiders near.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.720
I've only watched from afar.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.910
That place is heavily guarded.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.440
I have an idea.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.500
The medicine's effect

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.020
is surging again.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.540
Let's discuss the mausoleum tomorrow.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.900
(Governor's Mansion)

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.740
Governor Sun.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.890
Have you looked into the workers?

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.160
I have.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.150
The workers seemed perfectly normal.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.120
How could they be normal?

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.830
On my way to Yuzhang days ago,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.480
I found them acting
like they'd lost their wits.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.080
Their symptoms were
much like the Marquis's.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.590
Could they have been poisoned together?

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.840
That's my suspicion as well.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.120
At first, I thought it came
from the Marquis' decoction,

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.050
but my search proved otherwise.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.600
So, I'll slip into the mausoleum
to see for myself.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.760
No, you can't.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:47.750
That won't do.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.540
What else? You want to go instead?

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.520
Well...

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.140
Governor Sun, to be honest,

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:55.840
I came to Haihun this time

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.060
because of the Marquis.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.680
Until the Marquis' matter is settled,

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.990
I can't rest easy.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.960
Your devotion to the Marquis

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.440
truly moves me.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.540
Alright, enough of that.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.480
But how do you plan to get there?

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.620
That's why I came to you.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.570
I need your help.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.730
Disguise me as a worker
so I can sneak in.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.400
This place is so desolate.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.930
I feel uneasy in my heart.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.460
This is the Marquis' mine.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.550
Nothing would go wrong.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:29.870
Hey, sir.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.840
Where are you from?

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.690
Me?

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.600
From Youtang Village.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.480
So, you're not local.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.840
What brings you to Haihun?

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.030
I heard the Marquis pays in gold,

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.210
so I came here.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.440
Come on, line up and get ready to work!

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.690
Hey, sir.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.440
I have a question.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.520
How much can we earn here?

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.720
Follow orders,

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:56.760
work hard,

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.660
and you can earn as much as you want.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.050
Hurry inside.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.700
Stay close; don't fall behind.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.590
I want gold! I want gold!

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:07.840
Hurry, hurry, faster!

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.540
I want gold! I want gold!

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.730
Keep up, keep up!

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.320
I want gold.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.600
Move, move!

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.310
Stay close.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.410
I want gold.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.480
Hurry up.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:28.460
Keep up, keep up.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.750
The gold is mine.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:39.870
Faster, faster!

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.200
Quick, get over there!

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.960
Hurry, squat down.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.840
What are you staring at? Behave.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.560
Eat well.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.080
Have a bit more.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.660
There will be no food when you work.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.590
Hey, I haven't eaten yet.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.980
Then go hungry. Save your breath.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.760
Isn't there still some in your basket?

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.240
Oh.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.490
We've met
a hot-tempered tough one today.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.640
Hey, hey.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:23.790
He's being childish.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.980
Good, you know your place.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.330
Go on, eat.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.620
We're here for money;
no need to stir trouble.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.910
Thanks.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.100
Why do they act like that?

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.150
They don't even see us as humans.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.150
It's for the money.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.260
With gold in hand,
a little shame is nothing.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.260
Eat up, eat up.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.840
You need a full stomach to work.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.350
Alright, enough.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.190
Up, time for work.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.000
Up, quickly! Up, up!

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.870
You, come here.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.400
Move.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.480
Hurry, hurry!

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.600
Come here.
