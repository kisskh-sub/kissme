=Voyage to Haihun, Season 2=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.300
=Episode 3=

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.740
When did Crown Prince Li

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.100
leave this Liu Bingyi in the world

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.460
to ruin my great endeavor?

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.880
Now,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.530
the Huo Clan has also fallen.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.860
We must take our time to plan this.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.520
Duke, since Aunt has obtained the Qilin,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.010
should we get the spell first?

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.140
Fine,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.090
let's set aside matters
against Liu Bingyi.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.560
If we secure the spell,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.800
whatever you desire can be fulfilled.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.460
Why then fear Liu Bingyi?

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.500
Just as you said.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.050
This spell is known only to Liu He.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.450
From what I know,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.050
that is indeed the case.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.850
Go inform Li Nvxu

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.700
to seek out Liu He

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.940
and feel her out.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.730
As for what follows,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.790
take orders from Li Nvxu.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.010
Yes.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.270
Steamed buns, fresh-baked flatbreads.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.120
De Jiu.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.100
News about the Western woman.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.500
If we follow the clues,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.520
we should find her.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.680
Alright, let's move.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.190
(Hurry to Yuzhang; Find Liu He)

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.780
(for the Qilin spell.)

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.500
Stop right there.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.040
You're that sorceress, aren't you?

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.100
Hand over the Qilin.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.860
With just you lot?

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.140
De Jiu.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.760
De Jiu.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.160
De Jiu, wake up.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.720
What happened?

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.540
I think I saw Master and Uncle
trying to kill me.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.500
This is bad.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.440
She slipped away again.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.460
(Hurry to Yuzhang; Find Liu He)

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.870
(for the Qilin spell.)

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.020
If you wish to go, then go.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.740
For the sake of our past bond

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.260
and for the other half of the Qilin,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.960
you must go.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.500
Nothing escapes your eyes.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.540
Um,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.980
why do you think Liu He never
writes me back?

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.540
Why not just ask him face-to-face?

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.340
Or you could come along with me.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.100
Mm...

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.540
After we reach Yuzhang,

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.930
will we return to Chang'an?

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.220
We will.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.380
We'll definitely be back
in four years.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.560
Why four years?

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.860
Liu He has only four years to live.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.620
I want to bring him back here.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.060
Whether or not it changes his fate,

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.060
I still want to try.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.980
So come with me, will you?

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.580
Just like old times,

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.820
I'll take care of your meals, alright?

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.980
I mean nothing else by it.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.160
We're good partners after all.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.060
It's a bond forged in revolution.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.140
Besides,

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.420
you haven't seen Qingge in ages, right?

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.610
What is a bond forged in revolution?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.500
In your local words,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.130
it should be called...

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.750
"Through thick and thin".

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.180
(Weiyang Palace)
Your Majesty.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.030
Your Majesty.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.680
The title of Haihun Marquis

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.130
was more than generous.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.320
He needs you?

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.800
Doesn't the court need you?

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.310
Do I not need you?

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.380
You have so many officials to aid you.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.950
I have regarded you as their leader.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.020
If you go to Yuzhang,

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.560
what will others think of you?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.620
What will they think of me?

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.380
While tracking the remaining
Huo Clan members,

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.970
I found a witchcraft
group lurking in Yuzhang.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.220
I'm willing to go there
to investigate.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.240
I hope you'll agree.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.500
Official business, is it?

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.260
Just another excuse of yours.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.490
In the end, it's still for yourself.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.760
If he truly is in danger,

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.980
I'll send an elite guard at once.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.970
Or two units if needed.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.550
But you cannot go yourself.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.060
Ning,

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.700
what does it take to survive

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.860
in the martial world?

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.740
Nothing but loyalty and honor.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.540
When a friend is in trouble

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.860
and far from his homeland,

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.900
with no one to turn to,

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.140
can we truly just

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.540
stand by and watch?

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.640
You once saved my life.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.300
I must repay you one day.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.780
I'll stay in Yuzhang for four years.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:21.820
After that,

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.860
I will return to Chang'an.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.570
When back, I won't leave or lie back.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.910
When the time comes,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.140
whatever role you give me,

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.230
I will take it without question.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.540
Enough said.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.820
Since your mind is set,

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.380
I won't stop you.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:48.780
Thanks, Your Majesty.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.820
There's one more thing.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.160
Well...

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.330
those letters you wrote to Liu He

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.070
were intercepted by my men.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.650
I, as the Emperor of this realm,

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.910
cannot overlook your private dealings

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.300
with a former ruler.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.910
I must be on my guard.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.880
Hmph.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.840
No harm in telling the truth.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.930
If you're leaving,

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.340
I'll see you off.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.390
Your Majesty, you...

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.620
State affairs keep you busy.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.030
No need to trouble yourself over me.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.980
Yes.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.180
Indeed, His Majesty is busy,

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.930
then let

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.220
Ning see you off instead.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.560
- Your Majesty.
- Ah, Heng.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.300
Today I speak not as a ruler,

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.730
but as your brother.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.280
Then thank you, Kang, for seeing me off.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.820
Take a look.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.050
Huo Guang's sword.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.660
When you return,

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.530
you'll bear the Great General's seal.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.060
My thanks, Kang.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:13.900
You...

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.860
Ning,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.020
farewell and take care.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.660
Heng, though mountains and
rivers keep us apart,

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.340
my thoughts still linger here with you.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.820
Please return without delay,

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.430
and don't keep others waiting.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.330
I'll surely keep you
in my thoughts, Ning.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.380
Uh...

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.940
It wasn't me.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:35.860
Then who was it?

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.060
Let me ask you,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.760
what's the second rule of surviving?

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.760
Huh?

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.240
It's sentiment.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.500
Romance is sentiment too.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.180
As for her,

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.460
she's served you in vain
for three years.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.110
De Jiu.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.560
Great! You've decided to come with me?

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:33.620
Where's your pack?

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.490
What are you doing?

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.660
You can cross blades with me

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:06.980
and with your parkour skills,

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.300
you can survive.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.370
I thought you were plotting to kill me.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.400
What are you doing?

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.360
Putting my mind at ease.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.860
About what?

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:21.290
You go on ahead.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:22.710
I won't go with you.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.210
What's wrong?

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.100
Take care.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.660
Is this His Majesty's order
or your choice?

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.390
I have more pressing matters.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.250
You really must stay?

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.380
Yes.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.530
I understand.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.040
Once you decide, no one can sway you.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.800
Stay well.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.620
(Aren't you the same?)

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:04.930
If you take this blade,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.800
you must fulfill our order's duty.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.120
Protect the Crown Prince's heir,
Liu Bingyi.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.610
De Jiu.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.900
Are you willing to take it on?

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.000
Without Master,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.130
I would have perished long ago.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.860
And without your guidance, Uncle,

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.320
I wouldn't even know I bear this duty.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.540
I'll face everything without fear

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.020
to guard the Crown Prince's heir.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.140
Hyah!

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.400
Hyah!

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.330
Hyah!

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.000
Hyah!

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.490
(Yuzhang,
Haihun Marquis's Domain)

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.260
Hyah!

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.020
Hyah!

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.780
Hyah!

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.490
What's going on?

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.520
I do not know, sir.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.520
Where are they taking it?

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.490
Burning on the outskirts.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.540
Move.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.330
Why did they die miserably?

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.210
No idea, milord.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.260
Giddyup.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.260
Faster.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.550
Shopkeeper, a bowl of tea.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.720
Aye, coming.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.790
- Shopkeeper.
- Mm?

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.500
What work do these laborers do?

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.110
No idea, no idea.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.380
Might I ask, are you from Chang'an?

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.220
Lord Wang.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.530
- And you are...
- Haha.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.000
I am Sun Liao, Governor of Yuzhang.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.600
(Sun Liao, Governor of Yuzhang)
Greetings.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.770
Governor Sun, an honor.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.990
Why do these workers look so worn out?

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.600
Ah, Lord Wang, you may not be aware.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.100
They're here
to build the Marquis's tomb,

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.230
working day and night,

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.140
utterly exhausted,

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.830
as if life means nothing.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.190
Building a tomb for the Marquis?

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.840
Let's go.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.790
Take me to see him.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.700
(November, 63 BC.)

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.920
(The 9th month of Yuankang Year 3.)

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.240
- (Liu He's been titled Haihun Marquis)
- Well done.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.920
- (for over half a year.)
- Reward.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.960
Hahaha.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.460
Lord Wang has arrived.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.140
