WEBVTT

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:01.250
Qiuwan

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.708
Shen Qiuwan, Qiuwan

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.541
It seems she was taken by the monster.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.833
How could a monster abduct three people in an instant?

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.750
That depends on whether the Princess is truly human.

00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:38.125
Old Man

00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:40.166
Someone just tricked us into going east of the village.

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:41.708
Yes, and there was a monster there too.

00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:43.208
They wanted us all dead there.

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.541
What is really going on?

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:48.791
Old Man

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.208
Are you alright?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.083
The one who lured you out was probably Yu Ming.

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:56.541
Who is Yu Ming?

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.333
Why did he lead us into danger?

00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:00.166
Three went out.

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.583
Two came back.

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:05.166
Did the woman get eaten by the tiger?

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:08.458
There were four of us, including your grandson Gouwa.

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:13.791
Gouwa

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:15.416
They might not be dead.

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:17.000
Old Man

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.708
We need to know the truth.

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:27.000
Yu Ming is also a member of the village.

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:28.583
Originally,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.041
Guo Huai could keep him in check.

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:35.416
When the illness flared up, some lamb blood and meat would help.

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:36.458
What happened later?

00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:40.708
The person you met in the cave was probably Guo Huai.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.333
Their illness kept getting worse.

00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:47.750
Yu Ming wanted Guo Huai to eat you.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.166
That way, they would have killed living people.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.333
Once you enter the gates of hell,

00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:00.750
there’s no turning back.

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:07.000
What kind of people are you?

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.125
Uncle, Uncle

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.625
Wake up.

00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:18.250
Wake up.

00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:21.125
Uncle, wake up.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Gouwa

00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:32.416
Gouwa

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.708
You’re awake.

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:39.750
Uncle, play with me. I want to ride a horse.

00:03:41.583 --> 00:03:42.958
Alright.

00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:48.125
Hurry.

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.208
Stop!

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:51.416
He’s a human!

00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:53.333
Is he still human like this?

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.416
Enough, leave it to me.

00:03:57.708 --> 00:03:58.500
Let’s go.

00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:00.875
Why did you run out here?

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:01.958
Let’s go.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.500
Why did you pretend to be a monster?

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:09.375
Because I don’t want to go back with you.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.750
Everyone wants to rebel against their fate.

00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:16.041
You know him?

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:19.833
He and I were childhood sweethearts.

00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:22.125
Everyone thought he died at the border.

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:23.875
I thought so too.

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:26.458
But I always felt deep down

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:28.083
he was still waiting for me.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.833
On this journey,

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:33.208
I prayed to the heavens to see him once more.

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:40.250
The heavens answered me.

00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.333
General Guo didn't eat them.

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:10.250
They're still alive.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.166
He ate them.

00:05:11.666 --> 00:05:13.625
Guo Huai, General Guo.

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:16.875
He personally broke the commandment given to us.

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:18.416
He ate living people raw.

00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:19.041
No.

00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:19.833
No.

00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.083
I clearly saw that woman with Gouwa just now.

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:25.500
Either die,

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.083
or live completely like a beast.

00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:31.583
A life neither human nor ghost.

00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:33.375
Haven't you had enough of this?

00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.333
I find it very strange.

00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:38.958
The person we just saw didn't look human at all.

00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:40.375
The old man wouldn't let us kill him either.

00:05:40.375 --> 00:05:41.458
So who exactly

00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:43.916
is it?

00:05:47.708 --> 00:05:48.583
Qiuwan.

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:50.333
Are you alright?

00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:52.000
I'm fine.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.708
Good, as long as you're fine.

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:54.833
What about the princess?

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.291
The princess...

00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:00.916
She's beyond saving.

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:02.583
Let's head back.

00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.291
What do you mean, "beyond saving"?

00:06:04.583 --> 00:06:06.500
She's turned into a monster like the sand demon.

00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:08.708
Are you still going to take her back to the Imperial Court like this?

00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:11.375
You saw it with your own eyes.

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:13.666
In the cave.

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:15.916
Didn't you all see it yourselves?

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:17.833
Gouwa.

00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:19.333
Grandpa.

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:21.416
Child, are you hurt?

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:26.125
Grandpa, Uncle said

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.958
it was Second Uncle who wanted to harm them.

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:31.500
We can't go on like this.

00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:33.208
We must find the princess.

00:06:33.416 --> 00:06:34.833
Li Jingnian, what do you mean?

00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:36.416
Find her alive or dead.

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:37.583
We're just going back like this?

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:39.041
The Imperial Court won't let this go.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.791
Then stay here and wait for death yourself.

00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:43.208
Heroine, calm your anger. Heroine, calm your anger.

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:45.541
This boy is dead.

00:06:45.708 --> 00:06:47.375
The Imperial Court won't spare us.

00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:49.125
Nor will it spare them.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.916
It's Yu Ming.

00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:21.666
I have to go back.

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:23.541
Yu Ming wants to eat people.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.083
I must stop him.

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:26.708
Once you enter the gates of hell,

00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:28.250
there’s no turning back for them.

00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:30.291
But can you control yourself?

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:32.000
Your illness is worse than theirs.

00:07:32.916 --> 00:07:33.708
Don’t worry.

00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:35.208
With you here,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.541
I won’t fall into the abyss.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.458
Three years ago, war broke out suddenly.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.375
The Imperial Court sent elite troops to garrison the border.

00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:46.708
They were preparing to repel enemy attacks.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.125
The commander was named Guo Huai.

00:07:49.458 --> 00:07:50.875
Yu Ming was the deputy commander.

00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:53.833
Everyone was united and loyal.

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:58.208
But before we could fight the enemy,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.041
What happened to you afterward?

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:03.458
After that,

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:06.375
everyone was struck by a strange illness.

00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.000
Most died on the spot.

00:08:09.541 --> 00:08:11.250
We reported it to the Imperial Court.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.166
But the Court hunted us down.

00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:15.666
Their illness worsened.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.375
They could only struggle to survive here.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.166
But now,

00:08:21.458 --> 00:08:23.958
their illness is even more uncontrollable.

00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:27.750
They can no longer suppress the urge to eat people.

00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.875
Guo Huai uses military orders to restrain them.

00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:33.375
He won’t let them

00:08:33.583 --> 00:08:36.333
completely turn into monsters.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.833
Actually,

00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:44.333
Guo Huai met the Princess of Tang we’re searching for.

00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:46.041
They are old acquaintances.

00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:49.000
They’ve been together these days.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.416
Gouwa.

00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:52.291
Grandpa.

00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:54.625
This child’s parents were refugees.

00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.458
They starved to death at the border.

00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:57.958
I adopted him.

00:08:58.166 --> 00:09:00.375
The soldiers treat him as family.

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.333
You must take care of him for me.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.250
Grandpa, I won’t leave.

00:09:03.291 --> 00:09:04.041
Hurry.

00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:09.458
I’m used to being with them.

00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:10.958
They won’t harm me.

00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:11.375
Grandpa.

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:12.750
I know you have a heavy responsibility.

00:09:12.791 --> 00:09:14.041
As a soldier of Tang,

00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:16.541
I will fight for the people of Tang until my last breath.

00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:18.291
Go, go now!

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:21.000
Protect the child, go!

00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:22.208
Go!

00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:24.208
Grandpa, hurry!

00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:33.708
Jiang Sansheng of the mess unit, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Regiment, Vanguard Army of Tang, is here.

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:35.708
Let’s see who dares to act rashly.

00:09:39.916 --> 00:09:42.541
Brothers, wake up!

00:09:47.458 --> 00:09:48.333
Qiuwan.

00:09:49.083 --> 00:09:49.666
What’s wrong?

00:09:49.708 --> 00:09:50.791
Take the child and go first.

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:53.166
Remember, you must find the Princess.

00:09:57.708 --> 00:09:58.500
Go.

00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:01.958
Wake up!

00:10:05.583 --> 00:10:08.083
Why did you two fools come back again?

00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:09.541
How could we leave you behind?

00:10:09.625 --> 00:10:10.333
If we left you,

00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:12.791
our hero would never sleep peacefully again.
