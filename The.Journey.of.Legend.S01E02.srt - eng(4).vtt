[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.830
[Episode 2]

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.280
Do you know

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.120
who's behind the Gold and Silver Bank?

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.880
Who is it?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.280
Fu Tianyi, the demon of the Power Gang.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.460
So what if it's him?

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.400
Big Brother, you always say
we should uphold justice.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.000
You're the bravest of us all.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.030
Why do I feel like

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.610
you're a different person today?

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.490
It's actually because...

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.800
Because...

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.960
I got it!

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.520
It's because the Power Gang
has never meddled in Jinzhong.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.680
Big Brother is worried

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.140
that if we're discovered,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.079
they'll have

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.360
a reason to attack
the martial world of Jinzhong, right?

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.000
That's why
you want us to launch a sneak attack,

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:36.750
right?

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.030
I guess I'm a bit lucky.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.470
Yes.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.800
It seems Rou

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.160
understands me best.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.960
That's exactly it.

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.400
As expected of Big Brother.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.590
You think on such a grand scale.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.960
I agree.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.860
Big Brother, don't worry.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.120
Before we met you,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.400
we were just

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.840
three young punks
who practiced martial arts all day.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.240
You guided us to start upholding justice.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.910
Whatever you want to do,

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.030
just make the decision.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.360
We'll follow your lead.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.530
Alright.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.020
Then let's do this.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.720
Tomorrow,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.480
we'll set out for Zihui.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.280
Okay!

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.840
Okay!

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.079
Oh, no. I just remembered.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.220
In the original story,

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.370
that was where Tang Rou
suffered a sneak attack.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.210
Oh right, Tang Rou.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.360
I don't think you should participate

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.560
in this mission.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.630
Why?

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.120
It's because...

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.400
I met a fortune teller
a couple of days ago

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.350
who did a divination for you.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.680
It showed that this trip
would bring more harm than good to you.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.810
It'll be dangerous.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:06.400
Hey.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.630
Why are you laughing?

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.970
I'm telling the truth!

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.630
-Big Brother.
-Big Brother.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.010
Are you being serious?

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.010
Big Brother,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.750
when have our heroic deeds
ever been without danger

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.120
Besides, even if I, Tang Rou, were afraid,

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.270
the Rainstorm Pear Blossom Needles
at my waist certainly aren't.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.870
Hey guys,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.120
can't you be a little less reckless?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.650
I'm being serious with you!

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.950
Big Brother, why are you being so fussy?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.330
Did that fortune teller
put a curse on you or something?

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.920
Forget it.
Let's take it one step at a time.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.830
I should have read
the original story more carefully.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.270
[Zihui]

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.750
Come on.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.450
Take it slow.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.310
Here.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.690
Careful. Thank you.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.160
Thank you. Take care, you two.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.760
-We're leaving.
-Take care.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.750
Don't worry, madam.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.600
-We'll be there soon.
-Alright.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.240
One basket of steamed buns
and four bowls of beef noodles.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.700
Certainly. Just a moment.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.240
Have a seat, Big Brother.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.600
This way.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.160
Big Brother.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.600
Here, have some tea first.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.750
Bravo!

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.390
Here.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.800
These steamed buns look quite good.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.360
Bravo!

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.120
Drink some water.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.830
-Move, move!
-!t's too hot today.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.920
What are you looking at?

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.510
Move aside.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.070
Move!

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.360
Move, move!

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.290
Everyone, move!

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.840
Hurry up.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.000
This... this...

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.870
What's going on? What are you doing?

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:35.430
Behave yourself.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.240
Let me go!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.530
-Move!
-What are you doing?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.430
Please spare me, sir!

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.510
Please have mercy, sir!

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.970
I'll give you one more day.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.240
Tomorrow at noon,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.390
if you don't deliver the money
to the Gold and Silver Bank,

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.750
I'll burn this shabby boat of yours
to the ground.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.310
Stop!

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.300
What are you doing?

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.430
What's the matter? Want to be a hero?

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.240
So what if I do?

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.400
Sir, please don't fight!

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.430
Please don't fight!

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.270
If a fight breaks out here,

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.750
my business will be ruined.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.600
That's right.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.550
Did you hear that, young man?

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.270
They're going to save them?

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.000
One day.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.600
-Yes, yes, yes, sir.
-Just one day.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.130
Let's go.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.720
Let's go.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.000
Are you two alright, gentlemen?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
-Thank you, sirs.
-Thank you, sirs.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.720
Tang Rou, why don't you go ask

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.180
and see what's going on
with that boat captains over there?

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.720
Captain, what's wrong?

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.680
Don't mention it.
We scraped together all our savings

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.360
and finally managed to buy a boat

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.560
just to make a living.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.340
In the past,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.950
we used to pay tribute
to Zhu the Great King of the waterway.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.430
Now, we're using
the river's branch routes,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.750
and we're being extorted
by the Gold and Silver Bank.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.430
The war has just eased for a few years.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.890
How can we make any profit?

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.510
We can't keep this business going
like this.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.400
The Gold and Silver Bank?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.120
Them again?

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.430
Why is this Gold and Silver Bank
so tyrannical?

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.690
No one in the Wubei area

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.800
dares to offend the Gold and Silver Bank.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.390
They can make life

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.480
more miserable than death.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.480
Indeed.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.430
Here it is.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.280
The NPCs are here
to push the plot forward.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.510
Let's not talk about it anymore.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.680
Let's go, let's go.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.770
Let's go.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.360
Big Brother, it seems your lead
was right.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.160
They're such bullies.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.420
Big Brother, we must pay a visit
to the Gold and Silver Bank.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.800
Yes.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.830
Is there such a rush?

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.490
We need to plan this out.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.750
Besides, the noodles
haven't even been served yet.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.680
Come on, sit down and eat.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.920
What's there to plan? Let's go, let's go!

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.630
-What plan?
-It's too late.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.390
Let's go, Big Brother.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.950
Let's go.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.360
But I'm hungry.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.950
Let's go.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:44.630
Your sword!

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.800
Big Brother, this way please.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.190
Sir,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.600
-your beef noodles...
-No need anymore!

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.530
What's going on?

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.940
[Gold and Silver Bank]

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.440
It's right here.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.360
Come on.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.630
Brothers, come on, take these.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.010
Once we're inside,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.430
remember, don't reveal your identities
no matter what.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.690
Put these on properly.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.240
Big Brother, we're here to uphold justice.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.160
No need.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.600
That's right, let's go.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.310
You won't wear them for night operations?
Put them on!

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:22.830
Take it.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:26.430
Um,

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.470
those buns aren't sitting well with me.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.560
I need to use the toilet.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.070
You all need to be extra careful.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.570
Don't go, don't go.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.730
You're pulling this trick again,
aren't you?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.080
I know what you're doing.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.390
You're doing the same thing as last time,

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.150
trying to send us away

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.360
so you can face
the strong enemy alone, right?

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.960
Big Brother, let me tell you,

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.870
it's absolutely not happening this time.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.670
That's right.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.560
I'm not joking with you guys.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.430
Anyway, I'm telling you,

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.290
it's very dangerous in there.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.360
You must be extremely careful.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.240
Do you understand?

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.040
Please, please be very careful.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.080
There's nothing we can do about him.
Let's go.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.510
What do you mean?

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.440
I'm talking to you guys.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.570
Where are you going?

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.350
Isn't the entrance right there?

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.960
Big Brother, make way.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.840
W-What are you doing?

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.480
Move aside.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.780
What are you doing?

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.940
Oh my goodness!

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.250
They really can fly.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.600
How about

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.910
I give it a try?

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.080
No way,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.500
I don't have any lightness skills at all.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.440
This is today's rent from Hehan Street.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.150
This is the tribute from the 18 shops
at the street corner today.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.150
Good, good, good.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.510
That woman from the gold shop
said business was bad.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.440
She was crying and refusing to pay.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.910
I dragged her back here.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:11.550
Boss,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.120
what do you want to do with her?

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.320
Blind her

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:15.910
and throw her in the marketplace

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.640
to set an example for everyone.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.630
Who dares

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.250
to cause trouble
at the Gold and Silver Bank?

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.220
Do you know who the owner
of this place is?

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.880
Isn't it Fu Tianyi, the Iron-Fisted Demon
of the Power Gang?

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.600
Since you know,

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.030
why are you still here?

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.610
Not only are we not leaving,

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.530
but we're also going to

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.200
eliminate

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.270
you

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:55.940
trouble

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.630
makers.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:00.960
That's quite a bold statement.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.000
Chop them into pieces

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.530
and throw them into the river
to feed the fish!

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.360
Are we really doing this?

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.030
Zuoqiu's silk-binding
grappling technique is impressive.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.160
Clean and powerful.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.200
As fellow swordsmen,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.630
Yuhan's Hailin Sword Sect's technique
is known for its intricacy.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.030
His lethality is not to be underestimated.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.770
Flying daggers.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.480
The Tang Sect's hidden weapons
are indeed formidable.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.670
No wonder the Tang Sect
has stood strong for a century.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.440
My underlings are quite impressive.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.840
Blood... It really is blood.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.060
Where is Fu Tianyi?

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.930
I don't know.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.870
Escaping is the best strategy of all.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.600
Staying alive is the priority.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.030
Be careful.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:14.970
Alright.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.270
Hey.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:24.670
Captain,

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.170
where are you heading?

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.550
Sir, you are...

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.080
Don't you remember?

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.790
Yesterday at the dock,
when you were being bullied,

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.080
my brothers and I came to your rescue.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:38.750
-Oh, it's you, young hero.
-Yes, yes.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:39.870
It's the young hero.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.470
Young hero, you may not know,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.440
but we've gathered some silver

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.240
and are about to deliver it
to the Gold and Silver Bank.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.750
Yes, we hope they'll show mercy

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.720
and forgive us.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.520
That's right.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.840
You don't need to go anymore.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.390
Someone has already
eliminated the threat for you.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.440
How is that possible?

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.910
That's the Power Gang's
Gold and Silver Bank!

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:00.870
Indeed.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.630
Don't worry.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.670
No one will bully you anymore.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.390
Ah...

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.150
-Thank you, young hero.
-Thank you, young hero.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.910
Hurry and go.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.630
Lad.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.910
You hired people to wipe out
the Gold and Silver Bank?

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.320
Well done!

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.750
That Gold and Silver Bank
was utterly heartless,

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.440
committing numerous crimes.
It should've been destroyed long ago.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.240
Stop talking!

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.090
Young hero!

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360
You talk too much.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.190
A man fishing in the wind and rain

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.360
on the huge rock at the riverside dock...

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.380
He's the Iron-Fisted Demon, Fu Tianyi?

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.340
[Iron-Fisted Demon of the Power Gang]
[Fu Tianyi]

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.560
I've already run so far away.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.490
How can I still run into him?

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.910
This plot twist feels too forced.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.050
You go first.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.120
Okay, okay, okay.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:22.900
Don't move.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.170
Kneel down, kneel down.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.510
Behave yourself.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.510
Kneel!

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.390
[Northern Wasteland Seal]

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.390
I never expected

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.360
the Gold and Silver Bank would
conspire with Northern Wastelanders.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.000
But these people are too tight-lipped.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.910
We can't get them to reveal
the mastermind's whereabouts.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.170
We've fought all night

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.670
but still can't find
the Iron-Fisted Demon's whereabouts.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.000
These three young heroes
are incredibly skilled.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.840
Did you see?

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.740
They destroyed
the entire Gold and Silver Bank.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.390
Tang Rou.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.270
There's something I must tell you.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.150
What is it?

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.530
Be careful of...

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.070
What's wrong?

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.600
It's nothing.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.410
Remember this.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.530
You must be wary
of someone holding an umbrella.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.810
Someone holding an umbrella.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.740
Come on, you're really
being superstitious now.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.600
Well...

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.120
Besides,

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.970
it doesn't even look like
it's going to rain.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.360
Can you be more serious?

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.690
I'm not joking with you.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.440
Remember what I said. The key point is,

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.750
be careful of someone holding an umbrella.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.810
Do you understand?

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:39.970
Everyone has an umbrella.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.210
Who am I supposed to be wary of?

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:43.270
Exactly.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.840
These villains deserve to be
dealt with properly.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.500
The rain stopped so suddenly.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.440
The rain has stopped.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.700
The rain has stopped.
Who would still be using an umbrella?

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.030
Make way!

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.230
Heaven is on our side.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.480
The constables are here!
The constables are here!

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.670
They should all be arrested.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:57.240
Take them all away.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:57.840
These are the villains.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.270
Yes, arrest them all.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.270
Arrest these beasts!

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:02.630
Don't move!

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.430
That's right.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.220
Who are you people?

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:08.030
We're here to rid the people of harm.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.720
You government-paid officials
finally show up now.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.920
May I ask the names
of you righteous heroes?

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.680
We are...

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.589
There's no need to know our names.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:18.480
Those scoundrels
are locked up in the back.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.010
You can just take them away.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.720
The Gold and Silver Bank has been
exploiting the people for a long time.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.240
As a mere constable,

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.410
I've never dared to take action.
I'm truly ashamed.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:29.880
But I'm afraid

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.310
you've only caught some small fry.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.100
The real boss, however...

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.400
Do you know where their real boss is?

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.160
You need to understand.
If you don't tell us now,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.160
you'll be the ones

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.700
in trouble after we leave.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.510
Alright, I'll take you there.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:08.690
Oh my goodness!

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.840
Isn't that our Big Brother?

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.960
-Big Brother!
-So Big Brother found Fu Tianyi already.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.020
What did I tell you?

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.620
He ran off on his own again.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.920
Don't come over! It's dangerous!

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.660
Big Brother, don't worry!

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.240
We won't interfere.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.210
We'll leave
the toughest Iron-Fisted Demon to you.

Big Brother, you've got this!

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.270
Beat him up!

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.030
Come on, Big Brother!

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.200
You pig-headed fools!

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.880
What kind of encouragement is this?

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.080
Come on, Big Brother!

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.280

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:08.070
Big Brother! Big Brother!

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.030
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:09.960
Are you alright?

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:11.960
I'm fine.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.310
So my subconscious mind

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.640
remembers the martial arts
this body practiced before.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.000
Huanhua Sword Technique.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.350
Since when did Xiao Xilou's people

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.000
dare to oppose the Power Gang?

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.200
I heard you killed my men.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.830
Then stay and fill the vacancies.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.480
Work for me.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.170
You won't refuse, will you?

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:50.590
What do you think?

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.270
Of course we're not willing.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.130
You think you can order us around?

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.070
How could you all be a match for me?

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.240
One-on-one, of course we're not.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.960
But four against one is a different story.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.590
You think you have four people?

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.000
It's not a guess. It's a fact.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.920
What if I make you lose one person?

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.160
One less... Tang Rou!

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.270
It's you!

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.530
Are you alright?

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:39.960
Tang Rou.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.940
Good thing I have this.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.960
Here, take this.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.170
For self-defense.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:52.480
Underwear?

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.830
This isn't my size.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.680
Tie it around you.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.640
No one can ambush
a member of the Tang Sect.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.920
Remember that.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:11.640
Not one of us four will be missing.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.310
Then you four...

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.830
can prepare to die!

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.810
-Big Brother!
-Big Brother!

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.160
Charge!

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:10.960
Kill!

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.170
Is everyone alright?

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.790
We're fine.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.720
The Iron-Fisted Demon
lives up to his name.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.810
He's truly impervious to weapons.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.480
Fu Tianyi's hands are impenetrable.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.000
Tang Rou, Yuhan,

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:01.030
restrain his arms!

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.760
Zuoqiu, attack his lower body!

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.400
Go!

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.740
This move, the Flower Rain Sword,

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.550
uses the blade as a hidden weapon,

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.400
and the scabbard as the killing blow.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.530
It's truly amazing.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.350
He's dead.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.550
Big Brother, he's dead!

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:29.890
Big Brother!

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.310
We... We won!

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.000
We won!

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:41.920
Tang Rou,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.850
thank goodness you're still here.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.330
Of course I'm here.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.680
I... I actually used
the Xiao family's martial arts

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.110
to kill Fu Tianyi?

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.790
Of course you used martial arts.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.450
What else could you have used?

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:04.720
It seems

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.980
this Power Gang isn't all that great.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.200
Today, we killed the Iron-Fisted Demon.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.140
Tomorrow, we can kill
the Eight Heavenly Kings

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.620
and the Nineteen Demons.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.160
That's right, let's kill them all!

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.160
Eight Heavenly Kings, Nineteen Demons...

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.240
Oh right, in the original story,
the Power Gang

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.300
discovered that we killed Fu Tianyi,

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.000
so they besieged the Xiao family.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.660
This is bad.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:27.960
Yuhan, Chaoran,

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.480
go get some money

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.430
to silence that boatman.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.390
Tang Rou, go buy a small boat

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.990
and get some lamp oil.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:36.790
Why?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.400
What do you mean "why?" Just go quickly!

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.030
Don't ask so many useless questions!

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:40.830
Go!

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.590
Let's go.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:48.810
Someone really died.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.680
I...

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:55.200
What... What have I done?

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:59.720
Are we destroying evidence?

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.440
Brothers,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.400
don't think too much now.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.270
It's perfect timing to leave Zihui

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.640
before it gets dark.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.030
Let's go, let's go.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:15.560
Let's go.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.890
Sirs, your dishes are all here.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.880
Alright.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.000
Waiter.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.830
Sir, please enjoy your meal.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:29.030
Thank you for your hard work.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.350
[Everlasting Prosperity]

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.830
Come on.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.270
We should have run far enough by now.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.870
Finally, we can eat in peace.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.440
Chopsticks.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.400
Let's eat.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.210
Come on.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.200
By the way,

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.750
we clearly did the martial world a favor
by eliminating evil.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.400
Why are we acting like criminals?

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.930
That's right, Big Brother.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.310
Come here, come here.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.030
Why else could it be?

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.290
I'm afraid of dying.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:57.680
Afraid of dying?

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.030
W-When have we ever been afraid of death?

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:00.550
Yeah.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.030
I've known you for so many years.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.430
It's the first time I've heard you say
you're afraid of dying.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.900
Are you sick or something?

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:23.850
Come on, everyone.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:29.830
Let me ask you,

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:34.400
Is it more worthwhile
to kill one or 10 villains?

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:35.830
Killing 10, of course.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:36.630
That's right.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.750
As the saying goes,

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:44.000
"Keep a low profile, be humble,
don't get cocky."

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.160
That's true.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.880
Look,

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.070
the four of us

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.070
barely managed
to defeat one villain today.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.300
What if the remaining evil members
of the Power Gang

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.070
came after us together?

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.440
We'd be finished for sure.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:05.590
So...

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.000
We must prepare secretly,

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.680
quietly build up our strength,

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:16.950
and then gradually eliminate evil
and protect the innocent.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.250
When we have enough strength,

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.550
we can challenge the Power Gang.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.830
Then we'll kill them all.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:25.480
Come on,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.620
eat up. It's on me today!

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.640
That makes sense.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.680
I'm starving.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.510
I understand now.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.960
Big Brother is thinking about
building up our strength

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.420
to face the Power Gang head-on
in the future.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.510
Truly a role model for our generation.
I'm impressed.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:55.290
Well... That's not exactly what I meant.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.790
I got it!

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.830
Big Brother, remember that thing
we talked about before?

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.290
Today is the perfect time.

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:07.310
Yes, Big Brother,

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:08.830
now is the right time.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:09.400
Right.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.200
Let's forget about this cliché plot.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.240
How can we forget about it, Big Brother?

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.440
Three months ago, you said it yourself.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.510
After we've done a truly righteous deed,

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:36.290
we'll officially establish
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:40.750
Tang Rou.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:47.930
Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood?

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.880
Wasn't it the Four Brothers of Jinjiang?

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.340
Big Brother, what's wrong
with your memory?

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.530
You said it yourself

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.070
that we shouldn't limit it
to just Jinzhong.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.070
We should gather righteous men
from all over the world.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.590
That's why we formed
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.590
Today is the birth
of the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.270
The original Xiao Qiushui
was quite rebellious, huh?

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.830
Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood?

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.000
This name

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.130
is quite ambitious.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:16.550
Big Brother.

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:17.510
This knife...

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.450
-Has this knife been disinfected?
-Big Brother?

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:33.640
Do you have a needle?

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.450
A needle?

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.200
This... This knife isn't rusty, is it?

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.510
W-Why is everyone so intense?

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.000
Heaven above, with the moon as witness,

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.530
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood
will live and die together.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:03.310
Are they for real?

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.840
What's wrong, Big Brother?

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.410
Drink up!

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.000
Yes!

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.070
Cheers!

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.240
Cheers!

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.070
From today on,

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.600
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood
will live and die together.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.640
Live and die together.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.640
Yes, Big Brother!

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.710
Living together is fine,

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.140
but dying together...
that might not be necessary, right?

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.440
That's true.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.270
If we ever face a life-or-death crisis,

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.030
I'm willing to give my chance of survival
to Big Brother.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:46.680
Me too.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:47.400
Agreed.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:56.160
Why are you all
talking such nonsense so seriously?

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.880
Come on, stand up and talk.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.280
Stand up to talk. Stop kneeling.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.030
We are serious.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.200
Is Xiao Qiushui...

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.110
really worth all this loyalty?

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:15.320
That year when I first left Tang Sect
and fell into a villain's trap,

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.760
it was you who risked your life
to lure away the villains,

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.190
allowing me to escape.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.730
And at that time,

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.020
we were just strangers who met by chance.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.400
Big Brother, when Chaoran and I
went out to gain experience,

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.400
we recklessly fought
and injured our internal energy.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.460
You were just passing by at that time,

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.070
but you stayed with us in that temple
for three days and nights.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.030
From that moment on,

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.840
I knew

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:38.840
you were the big brother
I'd follow through life and death.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.110
The Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood
was born out of chivalry.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:43.780
As long as you're here,

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:44.780
chivalry exists.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.360
Yes.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:46.070
Yes!

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.670
This talk is getting
more and more inauspicious.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.930
What nonsense are you all talking about?

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:04.720
Since you all call me Big Brother,

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.480
it means you trust me.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:09.750
Then as the Big Brother,

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.500
I have the responsibility
to take good care of you all.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:18.400
So, we all need to live well.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.630
That's right, live well.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.110
Live well.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.590
Live well.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.150
Let me pour you some wine.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.010
-Let me pour Big Brother a drink.
-Fill it up for him.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:33.710
Xiao Qiushui was such a noble
and righteous young man.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.810
I'm using his identity,

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.630
so I can't let them down.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:42.760
Okay, as long as I can
complete the mission, I can go back.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.880
Before that, I'll protect them well.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.160
You spoiled key plot points to Tang Rou,

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.190
affecting the direction of the story.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.400
The Boiling Blood Cocoon
warning punishment begins.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.150
Countdown.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.760
Three, two, one.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.000
The Boiling Blood Cocoon
warning punishment ends.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.360
The next activation

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.030
will officially deplete
the user's health points.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.810
And from now on,
the plot difficulty increases.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.560
Difficulty increased?

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.310
How much more do you want to increase it?

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:08.590
You might as well kill me.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.960
I spoiled the plot to Tang Rou
and saved him,

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.230
which activated the Boiling Blood Cocoon.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:11.710
If it happens again, I'll really be dead.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.190
But strangely,

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.460
the Power Gang used Fu Tianyi's death

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.830
to besiege the Xiao family for revenge.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.240
But I've already disposed of the body.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:25.880
Why am I still dreaming about
the Xiao family being massacred?

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.680
Could it be that this isn't over?

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.480
Regardless, I need to be fully prepared.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.220
I can't let the original story's tragedy
happen again.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.540
If you can become the leader
of Huanhua Sect,

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.830
you can enter your own outline mode.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.400
The Magic Codex will no longer interfere.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.200
So if I become
the leader of Huanhua Sect

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:46.770
and eliminate the Boiling Blood Cocoon,

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.900
I can lead the direction of the story?

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:51.480
That would be perfect.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.160
How exactly do I become the sect leader

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.000
and change the story's direction?

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.920
Xueyu being an adopted daughter

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.180
was content I created.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.020
It means the Magic Codex
kept some of my characterization.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:26.150
What about the cheat mode I set up before?

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.030
If I remember correctly,

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.900
at the bottom of this river

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:38.120
is an invincible treasure sword.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.890
And in the cave here,

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.970
there's a white wolf
skilled in martial arts.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.880
In these ruins, there's a Gatling gun.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.540
And most importantly,

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.330
I created a lucky bag NPC named Feng Lang.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.070
He's highly skilled in martial arts

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:58.800
and completely obedient to me.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.400
As long as
one of these cheats is still here,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.800
changing the story's direction

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:08.840
will be much easier.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:11.500
Tang Rou!

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.440
Yuhan!

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.800
Zuoqiu!

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.280
Wake up, wake up!

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:20.390
Big Brother, aren't you
getting up a bit too early?

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:22.320
I'm so sleepy.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.190
What do you mean early?
The sun's already shining on your butts.

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:26.250
Still sleeping in?

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.320
Big Brother, it's raining.
Do we still have to go out?

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:34.760
Let me tell you,
this is called a sun shower.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.160
It'll stop raining soon.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.670
Come on, let's go.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:44.190
♪ Ha ♪

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:48.330
♪ Why don't we just
live freely in the world? ♪

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.960
♪ We meet again
after crossing mountains and seas ♪

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.800
Big Brother, take a look at this.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.440
♪ Heaven and earth between us,
yet never truly apart ♪

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:54.920
Catch!

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.040
The invincible magic sword?

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.590
Isn't this just a foot filer?

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:11.750
And that Gatling-something

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.030
is obviously just a chamber pot.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:16.000
And the most ridiculous thing?

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
It's this big gray wolf
that's supposed to teach martial arts.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.110
Go away!

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.150
Why is this white wolf yellow?

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:30.230
The system said last night
it would increase the difficulty.

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:31.150
Does that mean

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.930
it's going to take away
all the cheats I wrote?

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:35.110
Then Feng Lang, the powerful

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:36.110
lucky bag NPC,

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:38.430
definitely won't be here for me.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.090
Big Brother,

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.380
you woke us up so early in the morning,

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:45.360
but you haven't told us
what we're supposed to do.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:56.920
Actually, I did all this because

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.580
I just want to be the sect leader
of Huanhua Sect.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:01.800
Sect leader?

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.710
Big Brother, you're not
joking with us, are you?
