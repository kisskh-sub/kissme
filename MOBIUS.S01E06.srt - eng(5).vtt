Hello, Ms. Cai.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.680
I signed the resignation agreement
three months ago,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.920
but I still haven't received
the compensation.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.190
I can't keep up with my mortgage anymore.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.270
I'm already in this state.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.310
I've made it very clear in the message.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.190
The company found that
you had violated regulations,

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.830
so the compensation payment
cannot be made for now.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.720
But I didn't violate any regulations.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.070
how I violated the regulations exactly.

If we want to make further contact,

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.150

to add Hua'ao to her itinerary.

This connection with Volly

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.080
was entirely thanks to An Lan
acting as the intermediary.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.270

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:26.730
An Lan.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.560
Where are you?

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.550
On my way back to the company.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.150
What's your exact location?

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.200
M17 Junction

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.750
on Highway 1.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:41.860
Have the driver change the route

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.190
and exit the highway early
at the M16 Exit.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.240
What?

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.750
Trust me. Do it now.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.390
Sir.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.210
Please take the next exit ahead.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.570
But taking this route
will add a lot of extra distance.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.230
Give your phone to the driver.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.970
Reroute immediately!

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.950
The route has been successfully
recalculated for you.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.480
Who is he?

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.920
Just... One of my friends.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.200
Excuse me.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.660
Have you seen this person?

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.360
No.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.000
Excuse me.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.460
Have you seen this person?

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.240
No.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.510
We should be able to reach

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.480
Moma headquarters in about 10 minutes.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.550
Although we're a bit late,

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.320
we should still be on time.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:09.910
Yeah.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.480
What is going on over there?

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.720
Why are there so many people?

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.080
I'll go check.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.700
Never seen him.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.870
He looks a bit familiar.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.660
Take a closer look.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.270
I can't quite remember.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:41.750
Got it.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.560
Come here.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.610
Do you remember him now?

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:47.780
Police, huh?

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.820
I remember now.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.790
Ye Kun.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.390
We worked as extras together
for a few days.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.150
This guy

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.120
is good at martial arts,

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.560
so he played quite a lot of
those flying-around roles,

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.440
while we only got to play the roles
walking on the ground.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.360
Where is he now?

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.510
I don't know where he is.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.390
But if he's still flying through the air,

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.790
he must be in the studios.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:07.750
Someone's trying to jump off
a building ahead.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.350
It seems they lost heavily
in the stock market.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.720
Shall we walk over?

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:13.550
Yes.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.960
I still have to catch a flight
a little later this afternoon.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.790
Give me one sec.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.320
Okay.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:21.960
Get ready for shooting!

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.290
Costume team, hurry up!

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.320
Do you know him?

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.510
Oh, Kun.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:35.870
He's a stunt extra
from the martial arts team.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:36.600
He's on leave today.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.730
He said he was going to pick someone up.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:39.320
Okay.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.250
I'll send you the location.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.810
So there's a café nearby.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.470
We'll meet Mr. Mo over there.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.440
He's on his way now.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.320
Okay, sure.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.750
Sir, we'll get off here.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.820
Have you seen this person?

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.500
Yes.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.650
He's a regular here.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.180
Do you know where he lives?

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.270
He lives

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.790
in that building nearby.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:03.790
Which building?

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.089
We go this way?

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.359
Yes, this way.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:17.440
Qi.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.160
Let's go to a café.

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:20.920
We'll meet the investors there instead.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.829
Which café?

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.510
Not far. Super Coffee.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.280
[Fang Lu, find the Super Coffee nearby,
go set up early, and stay undercover.]

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.550
Ye Kun is on leave today
to pick someone up,

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.680
but he didn't say where.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.310
But I've found the area

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.790
where he usually hangs out.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.190
I'll go look there again.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.490
Why change the location?

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.000
They're stuck on Paris Middle Street.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.930
Apparently, someone is about to
jump off a building.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.550
Around 11 o'clock today,

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.960
someone tried to jump off the rooftop
of Yuehai Building,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.490
the highest building
on Paris Middle Street.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.160
The jumper has been in a standoff
with the police for hours,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.350
causing major traffic jams

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.350
and gridlock in the nearby streets.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.590
Tang Xin.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.350
Let's talk.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.160
Go ahead.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.400
Moma is divided into two factions:

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.400
the tech faction and the finance faction.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.160
Which one do you think you belong to?

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.560
I don't belong to either.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.160
I don't like picking sides.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.400
There's no middle ground.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.920
Those stuck in between

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.440
never get any bread.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.030
Then just take me

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.350
as my dad's shadow.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:52.790
The tech faction.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.880
You're just an intern,

00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.470
a junior technician.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.000
When do you think you'll be able to

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.800
climb to the top of the pyramid
of core technology?

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.310
Ms. Yu,

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.200
what exactly are you trying to say?

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.400
You're not as simple as you appear to be.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.480
Although you seem like

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.720
an innocent little rabbit,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.520
you've never stopped scouting.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.690
Sniffing around, exploring,

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.180
always searching for someone to rely on.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.300
If you haven't found that person yet,

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.400
come to me.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.400
I really don't like picking sides.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.310
And I believe

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.110
my dad didn't like picking sides

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.480
back when he was working in Moma, either.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.430
Everyone is in their own faction,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.270
and your dad was no exception.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.000
You seem to be

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
quite close to An Lan recently.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.640
But what's the use of her?

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.310
Although Mr. Mo gave her
some minor authority,

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.790
high-level tech executives
without significant shares

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.030
are still just employees.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.030
I'm sorry, Ms. Yu.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.590
An Lan and I are just colleagues,

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.110
merely working together.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.240
Our relationship

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.960
is simply that of a junior technician

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.160
and a senior technician.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.310
Ms. Yu.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.400
I've voted today.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.240
It can't be changed.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.920
But I don't understand

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.030
why you want to oppose your husband.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.960
I'm actually just like you.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.640
You came to Moma

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.350
to preserve your father's legacy.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:15.010
My situation is no different.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.440
Do you like the current situation?

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:18.960
You don't.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.310
Neither do I.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.360
But we have no choice.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.920
We have to preserve our business.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.440
Moma is like a weighing scale.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.830
Once it's out of balance,

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.110
everything will be in chaos.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.840
This also applies to my family.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.110
So I'm not opposing Mr. Mo.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.030
I'm just maintaining balance.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.350
Did my action today

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.790
make your scale lose balance?

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:41.510
Not yet.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.030
But if you stand on my side,

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.240
you can stand more firmly.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.300
Stop trying to get credit from Mr. Mo.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.980
He won't be able to give you anything.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.510
You're not An Lan.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.530
You're of no use to him.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.820
Think about it carefully.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.200
Come over next time.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:18.920
I'll show you around.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.640
Thanks.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.070
Are we there yet?

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.130
We're almost here.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:23.830
This way.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.310
Two Americanos.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:50.630
Thank you.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.510
What do you wanna drink?

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.110
I'd like a dark roast flat white with ice.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.750
Okay.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.960
One hot Americano, please.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.490
Okay, please wait a moment.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.600
Let's sit over there?

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:09.310
Okay.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.790
Thank you.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.370
Two Americanos.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.560
Send them over there please.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.640
Mr. Mo is here.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:16.270
Okay.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.960
Mr. Mo, please allow me to introduce.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.830
This is Maggie.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:27.350
Mr. Mo.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.790
Nice to meet you.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.070
Nice to meet you, Maggie.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.960
I'm sorry for the rush.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.590
It's okay.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.000
Please have a seat.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.640
Okay.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.830
It's our honor that Volly is interested

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.000
in this investment.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.110
Maggie said that

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.310
regarding the cooperation,

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.310
she'd like to make a decision
after meeting you in person.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.880
Okay.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.860
You'll see Moma's sincerity.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.490
I'm looking forward to it.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.350
So let's...

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.880
Dark roast flat white with ice.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.440
Thank you.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.350
Your Americano.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.950
Thank you.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:56.750
Sir,

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.350
would you like anything else?

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.610
Not for now. Thank you.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.000
Now, let's talk about the details.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.000
Okay.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.240
Volly is willing to sign

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.790
a bet agreement with Moma,

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:12.440
with the investment amount
about $200 million.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.240
According to the bet agreement,

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.350
if Moma's performance grew
by more than 50%

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.680
in the first three years
after receiving the investment...

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.620
Boss, the one in red
is the celebrity, Fang Zhou.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.270
This morning,

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.960
celebrity Fang Zhou appeared at a café

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.070
and was surrounded by fans,

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.310
causing a stampede at the scene.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.710
The injured have been sent
to the hospital.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:08.640
Mr. Mo.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.560
Can we go somewhere else?

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.330
Put on your mask.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.670
Fang Zhou!

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.590
Fang Zhou!

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.070
Sign for me, Fang Zhou!

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.920
Fang Zhou, give me your signature!

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.120
Keep it down, please!

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.830
Don't push!

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.510
Fang Zhou, look at me!

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.110
Fang Zhou, I love you!

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.810
Please keep it down!

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.590
One by one!

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.680
Fire!

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.880
This place is on fire!

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.070
Move!

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:02.480
Make way!

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.070
Make way!

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.480
Move!

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.710
Duck down and bend over
as you head outside!

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.710
Duck down and bend over! Be careful!

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.550
Go!

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.680
Go!

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:32.920
Watch your head!

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:33.590
Go!

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.500
Stop there!

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.200
Make way! Make way!

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.830
Move!

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.750
Move!

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.580
Move aside!

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.160
Make way!

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.790
Watch out!

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:40.320
Are you okay?

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.270
What happened?

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.600
Go support Boss! Hurry!

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.510
Move! Move!

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:50.200
Afraid of death?

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.400
Of course.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.080
Who doesn't fear death?

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.000
People like us don't fear death.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:58.720
What do you mean?

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:00.690
Don't move!

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.100
He's not a time loop perceiver.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.050
Where's your phone?

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:27.640
Boss.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.510
Why did you shoot?

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.750
In five minutes,

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.510
take him past

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:45.680
Mo Yuanzhi.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.880
Make sure Mo Yuanzhi sees him.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.850
In five minutes.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.270
How do you feel?

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.750
Not that bad.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:00.880
I still can move.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.960
Which area?

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.550
The ankle.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:04.590
The ankle.

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.750
How are you?

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.550
Are you hurt?

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.680
Thank you for saving me.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.350
You're welcome. It's what I should do.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:22.410
I'll remember you.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.410
I'd like to be friends with you.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.440
Ms. An, I think I saved you too.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.110
Do you want to

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.440
be friends with me too?

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.790
I'll remember you too.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.110
Thank you.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.720
How did you know about the accident?

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.960
Maggie.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.310
If you feel okay,

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.440
I have a suggestion.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.510
You could say
we've been through hardships together.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.400
How about we finish

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.330
our discussion?

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.680
What I'm about to say
is from the bottom of my heart.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.960
Qi is here.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:18.240
I won't lie in front of the police.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:20.590
Moma's current financial situation
is very poor.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:21.590
You know that.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.460
Within a month,

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.790
two of our executives were killed
one after another.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.580
The reason behind it is very ironic.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.640
All just because
we encroached on someone else's turf.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.830
Once the research on
the RAN gene-based drug

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:33.880
succeeds,

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.590
at least more than half of
the traditional pharmaceutical companies

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:36.350
will be affected.

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.920
So,

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.920
they don't want Moma to survive.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.030
They don't want me to survive, either.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.750
But it's precisely
because of their actions

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.510
that I realized

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.920
how outstanding our RAN technology is.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.030
But as long as Moma survives,

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.590
the research on gene-based drugs

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.000
will definitely succeed.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.750
RAN-X's development

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.350
has reached the final stage.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.720
Volly will be the biggest winner.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:58.440
No matter what,

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.680
I will lead the team

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.200
to continue the research.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.240
Volly stepped in
during our time of crisis.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.310
We'll definitely honor our promise.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Whether you

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.190
want to invest or not

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.710
will test both your judgment

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:11.840
and your courage.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:14.840
Okay.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.230
I'll report to the headquarters

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.190
and give you an answer
as soon as possible.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.920
Okay.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.030
Is he Squid?

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.320
We don't know yet.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.739
Do you know him?

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.150
Do they really not know Ye Kun,

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.030
or

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.740
is there a skilled performer
hidden in here?

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.360
Sorry, Officer Ding.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.360
I need to leave the country immediately

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.670
to catch the afternoon flight
from Xinggang to New York.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.190
If you need my cooperation with anything,

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.440
you can contact me via email

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.880
or video call.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.670
Okay.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.590
I'll get someone to give you a ride.

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.590
Thank you so much.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.220
Give her a ride.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.510
As for this investment,

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.320
I'm very optimistic.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.320
I'll give you an answer
as soon as possible.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.920
I'll wait for your good news.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.920
He's cute.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.080
Take care.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:49.320
You too.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.520
After midnight,

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.920
you'll still return to Hua'ao.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.480
What's your name?

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.050
Can't you understand Cantonese?

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.880
What's your name?

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:17.710
Speak.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:19.840
Okay.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.280
There are surveillance cameras
all around the square.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.880
I don't need your testimony.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.440
I didn't do anything.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.770
You didn't do anything?

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.470
Then who threw the smoke bomb?

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:32.430
What smoke bomb?

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.400
Fine.

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.750
If you don't admit it,

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.590
I'll show you
the surveillance footage later.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:37.760
It wasn't me who threw it anyway.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.890
Then why did you run?

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.030
He chased me. Of course I had to run.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.960
I didn't know who he was.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.360
I had told you we're the police,
yet you kept running.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.820
The police even shot at me?

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.670
He also said that
people like us aren't afraid of death.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.400
Don't talk nonsense!

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.320
I'm not.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.600
What does "people like us" mean?

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.630
What does "people like us" refer to?

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.030
I have my own difficulties.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:08.110
Besides,

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.510
was it really necessary

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:11.510
for you to write to Mr. Mo about this?

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.190
Watch where you're going!

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:14.440
If you have a death wish,
stay away from me!

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.280
How could you be so careless?

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.190
I'm sorry.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.670
Fortunately, the incident

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.590
didn't cause serious casualties.

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:28.400
According to statistics,

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.460
all those sent to the hospital so far
have only sustained minor injuries.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:42.910
[News Information]

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:47.430
[The lecture at Ivy Bay University
this afternoon may be postponed.]

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.870
I know you have questions to ask.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.400
Go ahead.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.880
Do you think Squid's motive for murder

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.250
was really business competition?

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.400
First it was Han, then Tang.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.090
And now it's my turn.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.800
Obviously,

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.680
Squid just wants
to destroy Moma Technology.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.160
Isn't that motive clear enough?

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.760
Then why did you suddenly reach out to

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.710
Volly Group

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:40.440
and Maggie?

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.480
I met Maggie

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.670
when I was an exchange student

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:52.590
in the U.S.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.800
After graduation,

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.550
she joined Volly.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:58.550
She told me a long time ago

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.750
that she wanted Volly to invest in Moma.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:02.510
But to be honest,

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:03.510
at that time

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.030
I didn't have a say.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.030
And at that time,

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:07.510
Moma didn't need Volly.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.100
These past few days...

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.040
It's okay.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.110
Tell Qi the truth.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.510
At this point,

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:24.260
we don't deserve to
keep any secrets anymore.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.510
During this period,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.970
which is after
the executives' murder cases,

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.300
I got in contact with Maggie again

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.400
according to Mr. Mo's instructions.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:40.760
I didn't expect that

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.550
Volly's interest in investing in Moma

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:44.670
actually increased instead of decreasing.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:46.670
Early this morning,

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.710
Maggie texted me.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.000
She said

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.230
she was in Xinggang,

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.360
and she was willing to come to Hua'ao

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.760
to visit Mr. Mo in person.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.610
Early this morning?

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:00.070
When exactly?

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.880
At 0:15 a.m.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:14.510
Maggie is actually the first person
to break the loop.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:45.320
An Lan.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:46.960
Have you got the materials
that Volly requested ready?

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.620
Right away.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:48.190
Okay.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.920
How is it?

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.880
There seems to be nothing off
with this Maggie.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.480
Her identity seems genuine.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:27.630
There are two and a half hours

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.400
until the university lecture.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:37.030
I'm in the open,

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:39.250
while Squid is in the shadows.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.000
In the first four loops,

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:44.800
nothing counts.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.640
He could simply obstruct my sight,

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.150
making it impossible for me
to judge the direction

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.480
from which danger comes in the final loop.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:00.710
Who exactly is he?
