00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.958
Soldiers,

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:03.791
Why are you so slow to drink this wine?

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.583
Are you disrespecting me, the Imperial Envoy?

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:11.625
Or are you disrespecting the Imperial Court?

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:17.291
Soldiers, listen to my command!

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.250
Yes, sir!

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:20.958
We thank the Imperial Court for its grace.

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:23.041
We will not betray our country’s trust.

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:24.375
After drinking this wine,

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:27.625
tomorrow I will lead you into battle.

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:28.833
Cheers!

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.000
Defend the nation! Kill the enemy!

00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:45.000
Defend the nation! Kill the enemy!

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:47.041
Defend the nation! Kill the enemy!

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.250
Second Brother!

00:02:17.458 --> 00:02:19.041
Doggy, come here!

00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:22.125
Don’t go! Find somewhere to hide.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.125
Go!

00:02:26.708 --> 00:02:28.208
You should be grateful

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:30.208
you didn’t run into me when I was sick.

00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:31.291
What are you trying to do?

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:32.958
Kill you all.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Think carefully.

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:35.458
We are with the Imperial Court.

00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:37.791
Imperial Court’s people.

00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:40.583
People from the Imperial Court deserve to die even more.

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:43.500
We used to be with the Imperial Court too.

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:45.458
But look at us now.

00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.000
What has the Imperial Court given us?

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:49.208
If you kill us,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.458
will your lives get any better?

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:51.416
If I kill you,

00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:53.583
the Imperial Court will just send more people.

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:56.041
The more they send, the more we kill.

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.750
There are plenty of empty stomachs here.

00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:03.333
You’re just the appetizer.

00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:40.875
Sixth Brother, what's wrong?

00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:41.708
Go.

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:44.958
Hurry, go!

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:49.958
Go!

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:04.000
Sixth Brother, wake up!

00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:05.833
Sixth Brother!

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.791
Wake up!

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:52.916
A few years ago,

00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:55.916
it was the wine brought by the Imperial Envoy

00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:58.791
that made us all sick.

00:04:59.416 --> 00:05:01.500
Most people died on the spot.

00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:04.291
Later, we found out

00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:08.541
the court didn't send us to fight enemies,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.750
but wanted to use our lives for a sacrifice.

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:18.291
To restore a dragon vein at the border.

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:20.375
Tell me,

00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:23.375
does a court like this

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:25.791
deserve our loyalty?

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:26.708
Yu Ming,

00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:30.041
you need to decide if you serve the court

00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:31.625
or the people of Tang.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.041
The people see us as monsters,

00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:37.375
as beasts.

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:40.291
They even gave us a name,

00:05:40.458 --> 00:05:41.916
Sand Ghosts.

00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:46.333
Humans and ghosts—

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.375
how can they coexist?

00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:52.291
Stop!

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.625
Qiu Wan, Qiu Wan!

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:05.666
This is our own matter.

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:06.750
You go ahead.

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:07.458
Old Master,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.333
this is military business.

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:11.791
Outsiders shouldn't interfere. Leave.

00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:13.500
Stop arguing.

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:19.208
Jiang Sansheng from the kitchen battalion,

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:21.125
are you defying your superiors?

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.875
To military officers,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.916
I treat orders as law.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.833
But against beasts,

00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:29.208
even if it costs my life,

00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:31.875
I won't let you do as you please.

00:06:40.208 --> 00:06:41.125
Princess,

00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:45.416
the Princess hasn't become a Sand Ghost.

00:06:45.708 --> 00:06:47.541
She just wants to be with Guo Huai.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.833
I lied to you.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.083
Princess,

00:06:50.583 --> 00:06:51.500
the court has ordered

00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:52.750
me to take you back.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.916
You're still thinking about the court now?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.750
They're fighting over there and we're still arguing here.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.625
Princess,

00:07:01.583 --> 00:07:03.041
please come back with us.

00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:17.041
Yu Ming, what have you done?

00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:18.291
So what?

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:20.000
We should've reached this point long ago.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.500
Sleep.

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:34.875
Old soldier,

00:07:41.375 --> 00:07:42.916
Tang military regulations:

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.000
infighting within the camp,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.000
those who harm their comrades,

00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:49.208
shall be executed on the spot.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.541
To uphold military discipline.

00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:54.291
Guo Huai,

00:07:54.375 --> 00:07:56.291
do you still see us as soldiers?

00:07:57.083 --> 00:07:59.291
Since we drank that poisoned wine,

00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:01.166
we haven't been.

00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:02.875
We're beasts now,

00:08:03.458 --> 00:08:06.000
beasts who want to live for ourselves.

00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:38.875
Elder Brother, Second Brother

00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:42.583
Elder Brother

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.500
Doggy

00:08:47.875 --> 00:08:48.875
Doggy

00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:01.583
Doggy

00:09:04.791 --> 00:09:05.625
Doggy

00:09:06.166 --> 00:09:07.125
Doggy

00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:08.625
Second Brother

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.458
You and Elder Brother

00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:12.708
Stop fighting

00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:14.750
I

00:09:15.666 --> 00:09:17.041
I'm scared

00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:20.375
Doggy

00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:29.875
All soldiers, listen up

00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:35.083
We once swore an oath

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.708
Not to fail our country

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.583
Not to fail our people

00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:41.125
Fight for our nation

00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:43.166
Die on the battlefield

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:45.208
Now

00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:50.250
If we cross the boundary between the living and the dead

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:54.833
We will end up harming the people

00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:58.625
Is this what we should do?

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:00.750
No, we shouldn't

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.208
Soldiers, don't forget our oath

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.708
Protect the nation and fight the enemy

00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:13.166
Now

00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:16.791
We ourselves

00:10:18.208 --> 00:10:20.791
have become the enemies of our own people

00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:31.125
Brothers

00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:33.500
For the last time

00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:37.500
I'll lead you to protect the nation and fight

00:10:38.583 --> 00:10:40.416
Heaven and Earth

00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:42.875
Blood seals our loyalty

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.083
Heaven and Earth, blood seals our loyalty

00:11:05.416 --> 00:11:06.500
Guo Huai

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.208
Wake up

00:11:29.583 --> 00:11:30.541
Doggy

00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:34.958
Doggy

00:11:55.416 --> 00:11:56.666
Guo Huai

00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:01.458
Princess

00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:04.791
Everyone has their own mission

00:12:17.125 --> 00:12:17.958
Lin Xiaoran

00:12:18.375 --> 00:12:19.500
Are you sure

00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:21.583
that the dragon vein where soldiers are sacrificed

00:12:22.083 --> 00:12:24.458
is actually changing the feng shui of the Tang royal family?

00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:26.000
Yes

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.666
From my observation

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:30.000
They're not using human sacrifice to restore the dragon vein

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.291
They're completely overturning and replacing it

00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:34.750
It seems someone powerful in the court

00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:37.500
wants to use feng shui art to seize the throne

00:12:38.833 --> 00:12:41.666
Sun, the magistrate of Fuping County, presented the Chapter of Ruling the Country

00:12:41.708 --> 00:12:43.583
to a high-ranking official in the capital

00:12:43.833 --> 00:12:44.750
In Luoyang

00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:47.625
another high official is using Liuxiang Pavilion to control officials

00:12:48.458 --> 00:12:51.500
Now we've found someone is secretly overturning the Tang dragon vein

00:12:51.583 --> 00:12:52.833
Behind all these events

00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.000
Could it all point to the same person?

00:12:55.833 --> 00:12:56.958
It's obvious

00:12:57.458 --> 00:12:59.583
Let's go, we head to Chang'an right now
