WEBVTT

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.098
So we really must play?

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:04.256
We must find the body in this building.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.581
We got a clue from Mamay
in the classroom of Grade 7-3,

00:00:06.597 --> 00:00:08.690
and from Benz
in the classroom of Grade 9-1.

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:10.969
That means the body is hidden
in the classroom of…

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:11.976
Grade 9 Class 3!

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.618
The Detective has given
an incorrect answer.

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:21.274
You said the body is hidden
in this classroom!

00:00:21.298 --> 00:00:22.938
Maybe this stupid game
is messing with us.

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:24.285
What if it’s not the game
that’s messing with us,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.300
but one of us is?

00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:36.200
Player, place your hand on top of the box.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.149
You are assigned as an Accomplice.

00:00:52.232 --> 00:00:57.107
Player will be assigned as an Accomplice
and must assist the murderer

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.956
by preventing the Detectives from
finding the hidden body.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.698
The Accomplice wins

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:07.103
when the Detectives fail to find the body
within the given time.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.100
What if it’s not the game
that’s messing with us,

00:02:04.304 --> 00:02:05.379
but one of us is?

00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:10.690
What do you mean?

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.904
I think one of us is lying.

00:02:19.195 --> 00:02:21.203
What do you mean someone is lying?

00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:22.583
Can you prove it?

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.105
- Right now I can’t.
- See?

00:02:28.194 --> 00:02:29.504
You can’t.

00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:30.987
You’re only leading everyone away...

00:02:30.993 --> 00:02:32.170
Can you shut up?

00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:34.467
Let him explain.

00:02:36.796 --> 00:02:37.796
If you remember,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.707
when we chose a room, we were asked
to place a hand on top of a box,

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.580
there was a graphic of the game
assigning us as Detectives.

00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:48.307
If we were all assigned the same role,

00:02:49.056 --> 00:02:52.102
there would be no need to tell us
what we were assigned as.

00:02:52.576 --> 00:02:54.786
You’re suggesting someone
has been given a different assignment.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.810
Yes.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.720
And I bet their purpose is the opposite of
what Detectives are assigned to do.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.170
I think it could be to lead Detectives
away from finding the body.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.330
Has anyone ever played
any spy-themed board games?

00:03:09.225 --> 00:03:10.225
What is that?

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.651
In spy-themed board games,

00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:15.375
each player is assigned a different role
to accomplish a mission.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.870
But one of the players is
assigned as a spy

00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:20.168
to stop the other players
from completing their mission.

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:22.887
What can we do to find the spy?

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.869
We have to think everyone is suspicious.

00:03:35.453 --> 00:03:37.333
One person among the six of you
must be the spy.

00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:38.501
Seven of us,

00:03:40.217 --> 00:03:40.975
with you included.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.610
- Are you accusing me, jerk?
- This is no time to be fighting.

00:03:50.138 --> 00:03:52.178
There’s only one person
who is suspicious right now.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.102
Who are you talking about?

00:03:56.701 --> 00:03:57.701
You.

00:04:01.476 --> 00:04:03.301
The clues you and Mamay got

00:04:04.105 --> 00:04:05.702
led us to this room.

00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:08.891
But when Mamay went in,
the answer turned out to be wrong.

00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:11.203
So one of the clues is wrong.

00:04:11.698 --> 00:04:13.106
If Mamay didn’t lie about her clue,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.926
it means you did.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840
Hey, wait, wait.

00:04:18.117 --> 00:04:19.003
Hang on a minute.

00:04:19.074 --> 00:04:20.403
I didn’t lie!

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.901
That’s what I found
in the room I entered!

00:04:23.548 --> 00:04:26.105
Who’s to say the spy isn’t Mamay?

00:04:26.273 --> 00:04:29.504
What if she sacrificed herself
to mess with all of you?

00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:31.304
Why don’t we prove

00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:36.578
who between Benz and Mamay
is actually a liar?

00:04:38.532 --> 00:04:39.243
How?

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.158
Someone should enter
the classroom Mamay went in,

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.556
if we got the same clue as she did,
that means Benz is lying.

00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:48.505
You’re accusing me.

00:04:48.768 --> 00:04:49.768
We’ll do that.

00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:52.505
We need to prove who’s lying.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.303
I’m your friend, damn you!

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:56.079
Don.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.130
GRADE 7 CLASS 3

00:05:06.623 --> 00:05:07.903
I’ll go in.

00:05:08.215 --> 00:05:11.900
How would I be sure you and Mamay
aren’t in cahoots and lying to us?

00:05:12.425 --> 00:05:13.425
Then I’ll do it.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.390
Kaen.

00:05:30.777 --> 00:05:32.182
Can I talk to you for a minute?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.895
The spy-themed game you mentioned,

00:05:40.158 --> 00:05:41.638
are there any other particular rules?

00:05:41.726 --> 00:05:43.509
In the game Werewolves
that I played before,

00:05:43.731 --> 00:05:45.100
there are other roles,

00:05:45.356 --> 00:05:47.796
such as Seers, who can see
who the moles are,

00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:52.102
and Bodyguards, who can protect
the players of their own choosing.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.198
So each role has its own ability?

00:05:55.433 --> 00:05:57.000
I guess you can call it ‘ability.’

00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:58.945
Although, not every role has one.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.659
There’s nothing in this room.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.455
See? I told you Mamay was lying!

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.904
What should we do now?

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.370
Should we recheck the Grade 9-1 classroom
that Benz entered, too?

00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:18.098
Hey!

00:06:18.188 --> 00:06:19.494
Are you trying to corner me?

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.920
No.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.072
Don’t forget we’re also looking for
where the body is hidden.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.756
If we can confirm that Benz’s words
are truly trustworthy,

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.303
we can eliminate the wrong choices.

00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:33.954
Unless… you have problems
with us finding the body.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.300
Who will go in and recheck?

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.560
Well?

00:06:51.743 --> 00:06:52.804
It’s your idea.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.240
Why don’t you do the honor?

00:06:56.662 --> 00:06:57.662
What?

00:06:57.894 --> 00:06:59.006
Chickening out?

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.120
Enough.

00:07:01.812 --> 00:07:03.446
Ow, man.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.005
Your girl is right over there.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.726
No need to put up the chivalric act
to win another girl’s heart.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.157
You’re a casanova, aren’t you?

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.410
Benz, you bastard!

00:07:10.452 --> 00:07:11.452
Yeah?

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.812
- What you gonna do? Come at me!
- Shut up!

00:07:12.827 --> 00:07:15.501
I’ll prove it myself if Benz was lying.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.609
There really is a clue in this room.

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:40.000
I saw the light turn green and someone’s
silhouette to the right of the room.

00:07:40.738 --> 00:07:41.738
Well?

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:42.910
Will you believe me now?

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.707
It was Mamay who lied!

00:07:45.655 --> 00:07:48.298
And I bet you someone else is helping her.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.551
Who would be a better choice
than the person...

00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:51.935
who went in the room next to hers?

00:07:52.612 --> 00:07:53.612
I didn’t lie!

00:07:54.027 --> 00:07:55.805
There really was no clue in that room.

00:07:56.359 --> 00:07:57.359
Then it’s you.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.050
You’ve been accusing everyone
all this time.

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:01.600
You’re the spy!

00:08:02.813 --> 00:08:04.300
What makes you think so?

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.700
Because you lied!

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.350
And how will you prove that?

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.200
We found the clue on this floor.

00:08:14.033 --> 00:08:15.402
The body should be on this floor,

00:08:15.705 --> 00:08:17.103
in either Class 2 or 4.

00:08:17.516 --> 00:08:20.010
It’s either you or Kaen who’s the spy.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:25.930
Fine.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.150
I’m the spy.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.135
I lied to you all.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.657
The body is in Room 4.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.055
Why don’t you spend your coin
and prove it

00:08:36.778 --> 00:08:37.805
so we can end this game?

00:08:41.313 --> 00:08:42.904
Kaen, you’re dying to know, aren’t you?

00:08:43.264 --> 00:08:44.264
You do it.

00:08:46.277 --> 00:08:47.277
Hold on.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.583
If we spend the coins recklessly,
we’ll only lose more of them in vain.

00:08:52.709 --> 00:08:55.309
I think we should all take our coins out
and see how many we have.

00:08:55.938 --> 00:08:56.938
We can plan from there.

00:09:00.105 --> 00:09:01.500
I have two coins left,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.857
since I spent one in the first round.

00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:06.172
I have two as well.

00:09:06.467 --> 00:09:07.802
I also have two.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.102
I spent two coins. I only have one left.

00:09:10.713 --> 00:09:11.713
I have two.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:13.170
So do I.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.610
And you, Benz?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.504
Why are we wasting our time with this?

00:09:19.702 --> 00:09:20.804
We’re running out of time.

00:09:22.285 --> 00:09:23.568
You should have two coins left,

00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:25.397
since you only used one.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.310
Take them out if you have them,

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.110
otherwise it means you don’t

00:09:30.123 --> 00:09:31.963
because you’ve already
spent them on something.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.310
When Kaen and Mark
went inside the classrooms,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.150
I saw you put your hand in your pocket,
doing nobody knows what.

00:09:46.012 --> 00:09:48.407
Since the purpose of this game
is to find the body,

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:52.098
the spy’s duty is likely to prevent
the Detectives from finding it,

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.012
maybe by giving misinformation
or something more.

00:09:56.876 --> 00:09:57.876
Something more?

00:09:58.401 --> 00:09:59.406
What do you mean?

00:09:59.764 --> 00:10:03.606
Maybe the spy has the ability to stop
the Detectives from finding the body.

00:10:04.483 --> 00:10:06.700
And that ability may come
with a condition.

00:10:07.283 --> 00:10:08.303
Condition?

00:10:09.168 --> 00:10:10.600
Such as by spending these coins.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.270
Because, to be honest, the spy has
no need to spend the coins with us,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.701
but maybe there are
other reasons that require it.

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:20.801
Don’t spout nonsense.

00:10:21.352 --> 00:10:22.801
Then show us your coins.

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:25.999
Don.

00:10:26.603 --> 00:10:28.003
This jerk is asking for it.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.840
- I bet he hates us from the start.
- Don’t change the subject.

00:10:31.036 --> 00:10:32.036
Show me your coins.

00:10:32.988 --> 00:10:33.988
I…

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:35.842
Where are they?

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:38.404
You don’t have any coins left,

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.410
because you already spent them
on that special ability.

00:10:45.369 --> 00:10:50.979
The Accomplice can falsify a lead
by breaking the medium coin in half

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.930
in front of the room they want
the lead to be falsified.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.702
There really is a clue in this room.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.946
There’s nothing in this room.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.505
Each coin can be used
to falsify a lead once.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:05.456
So you’re the spy.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.455
How dare you fool me, Benz?

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.104
Dude, calm the hell down.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.916
I’m just following the rules of the game.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.407
Tell us where the body is hidden.

00:11:14.863 --> 00:11:15.560
No can do.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.490
- If I tell you, I lose.
- Benz, you jerk!

00:11:20.253 --> 00:11:21.403
Wait for me.

00:11:22.273 --> 00:11:23.633
There’s something I need to prove.

00:11:24.318 --> 00:11:25.438
Will you come with me, Kaen?

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.397
I want to know if the spy’s ability
lasts the whole game.

00:11:34.369 --> 00:11:36.700
From my experience,
it is usually a one-time action.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.780
Why do you ask?

00:11:38.757 --> 00:11:40.603
I need to prove the spy’s ability.

00:11:41.023 --> 00:11:44.606
I saw Benz reach into his pocket after
you entered the room to recheck the lead.

00:11:45.707 --> 00:11:47.402
Benz must have done something to the coin.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.787
I think that is the condition the game
calls for in order to use that ability.

00:11:51.603 --> 00:11:52.990
I want to recheck this room again.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.490
GRADE 7 CLASS 3

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.904
There are two possibilities:

00:12:06.016 --> 00:12:08.801
First, if I don’t find the clue in this room,

00:12:09.186 --> 00:12:11.604
maybe the spy has the ability
to move the body.

00:12:13.473 --> 00:12:16.006
Second, if I do find the clue in the room,

00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:18.701
maybe the spy has the ability
to falsify the lead.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.220
How was it?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.440
Did you get anything?

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.801
I rechecked Class 7-3.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.902
I got the same lead as Mamay.

00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:42.901
I think Benz has the ability
to falsify a lead.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.820
Benz must have falsified the lead
in the room you entered just now.

00:12:49.287 --> 00:12:50.610
From Kaen’s diagram,

00:12:50.796 --> 00:12:54.036
we’ve confirmed that the body is hidden
in one of the rooms above Grade 7-3 class.

00:12:54.247 --> 00:12:58.450
It may be hidden on the second,
fourth, fifth, and sixth floor.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.341
We can eliminate
the fourth and fifth floors,

00:13:00.351 --> 00:13:02.271
since Mark and I confirmed
that there is no body.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.500
Now we have the second floor,
where Pie entered and didn’t get any clue,

00:13:05.729 --> 00:13:08.304
and the sixth floor,
where no one has entered yet.

00:13:08.584 --> 00:13:11.184
Does that mean those are the two floors
we should check out first?

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Yes.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:14.290
We’ll start with the second floor.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.690
GRADE 8 CLASS 1

00:13:21.732 --> 00:13:23.402
There is no clue in this room.

00:13:24.277 --> 00:13:25.717
That leaves us with the sixth floor.

00:13:25.827 --> 00:13:26.827
Let’s go.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.930
GRADE 12 CLASS 1

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.501
I found a clue
to the right side of the room.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.700
So the body is in the
Grade 12 Class 3 classroom?

00:13:42.202 --> 00:13:43.702
We’re running out of time, Mark.

00:13:43.788 --> 00:13:45.207
Let’s get in and answer.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.120
Let’s go.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.450
GRADE 12 CLASS 3

00:13:54.381 --> 00:13:56.152
It should be me who answers it.

00:13:56.756 --> 00:13:57.860
I’m the only person with two coins now.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.880
Hold on.

00:13:59.251 --> 00:14:01.171
If we get the answer wrong,
you will be confined,

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.703
and we will lose two coins.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.004
Let’s play it safe.

00:14:06.452 --> 00:14:07.704
I only have one coin left.

00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:09.408
I’ll answer.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.801
Coach must be real mad at me right now.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.060
I skipped practice, after all.

00:14:27.981 --> 00:14:29.707
I’m starving.

00:14:30.214 --> 00:14:31.936
You’re the last person
I wanna hear right now.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.040
This is all because of you.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.507
What? I was just playing along, bud.

00:14:35.618 --> 00:14:37.802
I don’t know what losing will cost me.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.381
I don’t want to lose
and I don’t want to give up.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.110
You still hope to win?

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.320
I don’t know.

00:14:49.452 --> 00:14:51.172
The Detective has given
an incorrect answer.

00:14:51.483 --> 00:14:54.905
The Detective will be punished
by confinement.

00:14:59.586 --> 00:15:00.120
What?

00:15:00.587 --> 00:15:01.587
Kaen!

00:15:03.293 --> 00:15:04.293
Kaen!

00:15:04.866 --> 00:15:05.866
Kaen!

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:07.155
Kaen!

00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:11.473
Kaen!

00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:12.786
What the hell did you do, Benz?

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.250
What could I do?

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.101
I’m out of coins. See?

00:15:16.294 --> 00:15:17.694
I’ll turn out my other pocket, too.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.330
Everyone, show me your coins.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.660
The amount of coins is correct.

00:15:29.225 --> 00:15:30.500
Our leads didn’t lie.

00:15:32.783 --> 00:15:33.783
But I think someone did.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.704
Either Benz has another ability,

00:15:40.045 --> 00:15:41.730
or this could mean there is another spy.

00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:44.700
Your lead led us here.

00:15:45.693 --> 00:15:47.805
You even admitted earlier to being a spy.

00:15:48.226 --> 00:15:49.603
I told you what I saw.

00:15:50.323 --> 00:15:51.323
I’ll prove it.

00:15:53.323 --> 00:15:54.323
Don!

00:15:54.742 --> 00:15:55.742
Don, wait.

00:15:56.608 --> 00:15:57.608
Come on!

00:15:58.552 --> 00:15:59.552
Shit!

00:16:10.332 --> 00:16:11.625
There is no clue.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.520
She lied.

00:16:15.177 --> 00:16:16.650
She’s the other spy.

00:16:18.398 --> 00:16:20.502
Who is to say you’re not the one lying?

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.458
You’re just as suspicious,

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.570
and stupid enough to waste another coin.

00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:25.718
- You jerk!
- Hey!

00:16:26.831 --> 00:16:28.071
This is no time to be fighting.

00:16:28.726 --> 00:16:30.200
We have less than 10 minutes.

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:31.981
Let’s just get this over with.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.136
But we still don’t know
who the other spy is.

00:16:35.295 --> 00:16:36.295
She is.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.460
Arguing won’t do us any good right now.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.734
Anyone can be lying.

00:16:43.273 --> 00:16:44.833
Let’s just find a way to end this game.

00:16:44.887 --> 00:16:46.401
Don has spent one coin.

00:16:46.866 --> 00:16:48.469
Now everyone has one coin each.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.680
If the body is hidden in
one of the Class 3’s,

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.597
that leaves us the second,
fourth, and fifth floors.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.800
The body must be in one of these rooms.

00:16:58.665 --> 00:16:59.802
We have no time.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.390
We have to enter all three rooms
at the same time.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.840
We need to save two coins
for our final answer.

00:17:05.264 --> 00:17:06.464
Does anyone want to volunteer?

00:17:06.955 --> 00:17:07.523
I will.

00:17:07.889 --> 00:17:08.889
Me, too.

00:17:09.417 --> 00:17:10.417
Count me in.

00:17:11.219 --> 00:17:12.036
Let’s split up, then.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:12.560
GRADE 10 CLASS 1

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.090
GRADE 8 CLASS 1

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:14.090
GRADE 11 CLASS 1

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.255
Guys, there’s a clue in my room.

00:17:30.511 --> 00:17:33.903
There was a green light
and someone’s silhouette.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.210
On the fourth floor?

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.158
But Mark went in and found nothing.

00:17:42.028 --> 00:17:43.106
I found a clue.

00:17:43.387 --> 00:17:44.387
The light turned green.

00:17:45.574 --> 00:17:47.109
I found a clue in my room.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.490
How can there be a clue in all the rooms?

00:17:51.002 --> 00:17:52.910
Which room is the right one?

00:17:54.304 --> 00:17:55.501
Someone is lying.

00:17:56.233 --> 00:17:57.305
One of us is.

00:17:58.274 --> 00:18:01.397
You’re so quick to accuse others,
maybe it’s you who’s lying.

00:18:03.729 --> 00:18:04.769
We’re running out of time.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.258
I think we need to answer.

00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:08.009
Just take one room each or something.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.250
Can you all tell me what you saw
when you got the clue?

00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:26.105
The light turned green!

00:18:26.353 --> 00:18:28.205
Yes. And I saw someone’s silhouette.

00:18:28.677 --> 00:18:29.677
Why are you asking?

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.470
What is the last thing you heard
at the end of the line

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.304
after the light turned green?

00:18:36.956 --> 00:18:37.956
Don’t say it.

00:18:41.183 --> 00:18:42.203
Write it down.

00:18:43.916 --> 00:18:44.916
Don’t tell each other.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.200
One person has written a different answer.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.690
HELP.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:06.854
If you really got the clue,

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.190
You would know this isn’t what she says.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.536
PLEASE FIND ME.

00:19:13.554 --> 00:19:14.973
Please find me.

00:19:18.076 --> 00:19:19.501
You’re the spy, aren’t you?

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.530
Pie.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.202
You are assigned as an Accomplice.

00:19:37.696 --> 00:19:39.296
You didn’t get any clue at all.

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:41.449
You simply remember
what Mamay said from earlier.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.520
Is there a way to make the clue
appear in all three rooms?

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.250
Yes.

00:19:47.927 --> 00:19:49.702
The first room has the real clue.

00:19:51.228 --> 00:19:52.898
The person who went in really found it.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.670
The second room is the one
that the spy entered.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:59.176
There’s nothing in that room.

00:19:59.177 --> 00:20:00.177
GRADE 10 CLASS 1

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.551
The spy lied that there was.

00:20:02.513 --> 00:20:06.055
As for the third room, instead of using
the coin to get the information for us,

00:20:06.685 --> 00:20:08.801
the spy used it to falsify the lead.

00:20:13.538 --> 00:20:14.655
From this information,

00:20:14.738 --> 00:20:18.403
we can summarize that there is definitely
no clue in the room Pie went in.

00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:23.403
So the body is either on
the second or fifth floor.

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:25.229
We have exactly two coins left.

00:20:25.399 --> 00:20:26.496
Doesn’t that mean we won?

00:20:26.615 --> 00:20:27.667
It’s too early to celebrate.

00:20:27.684 --> 00:20:28.803
We’re almost out of time.

00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:32.951
Let’s split up.

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.070
You go to the fifth floor.

00:20:34.086 --> 00:20:35.206
I’ll go to the second floor.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.200
GRADE 8 CLASS 3

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.750
Game over.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.506
The Detectives won.

00:21:28.049 --> 00:21:28.588
Yes!

00:21:29.043 --> 00:21:30.141
- We won!
- Damn it!

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.603
Thank you for finding me.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:01.030
Mamay!

00:22:02.371 --> 00:22:03.371
Kaen?

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:04.963
Are you alright?

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:06.926
Is the game over now?

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.606
Yes, Mamay! It’s over now.

00:22:17.888 --> 00:22:18.888
Hey, Samut.

00:22:27.488 --> 00:22:30.107
Mamay and Kaen would have been
stuck here without you, man.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.280
Thank you, Samut.

00:22:58.134 --> 00:22:59.134
Hey.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.304
I’m sorry I lied when we were
playing the game earlier.

00:23:04.409 --> 00:23:06.803
I didn’t know what was in store
for me if I lost.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:09.940
Don.

00:23:10.211 --> 00:23:11.904
Fine. I understand.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.201
But if you lie to me again,
you’re a dead man.

00:23:17.163 --> 00:23:19.906
Thank you, all of you,

00:23:20.618 --> 00:23:22.004
for playing until the very end.

00:23:23.509 --> 00:23:26.501
I’m still a bit shaken to be locked up
in that room, actually.

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:30.606
I even thought I would be
stuck in there forever.

00:23:31.755 --> 00:23:32.875
You have Samut to thank for.

00:23:35.349 --> 00:23:36.970
We wouldn’t have won without him.

00:23:44.028 --> 00:23:46.202
Here is the result of this game:

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:47.901
The Detectives won,

00:23:48.043 --> 00:23:50.698
and will be rewarded with one medal each.

00:24:10.313 --> 00:24:11.313
None for me, huh?

00:24:12.072 --> 00:24:13.072
Well, you lost.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.379
I don’t mind not winning,

00:24:15.707 --> 00:24:17.603
as long as losing
doesn’t cost me anything.

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:19.806
I just want to go home.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.101
Is the game really over?

00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:30.631
Oh?

00:24:38.312 --> 00:24:39.204
What are you all doing here?

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.330
Why are you still at school at this hour?

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:43.670
Was there a security guard in the game?

00:24:44.756 --> 00:24:46.179
My phone is back on!

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.303
We really are back to school.

00:24:52.072 --> 00:24:52.600
Excuse me.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.857
What day is today and what year is it?

00:24:55.204 --> 00:24:55.852
Ugh.

00:24:56.197 --> 00:24:58.901
It’s January 27, 2025.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.418
We really are back.

00:25:11.523 --> 00:25:13.598
I think we should all go home.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.920
It’s late.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.569
CONGRATULATIONS,
MR. SAMUT WONGMETHIN

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:30.130
CERTIFICATE FOR
MR. SAMUT WONGMETHIN

00:25:37.643 --> 00:25:38.806
Hello, Mom. Dad.

00:25:39.091 --> 00:25:40.091
Samut?

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.302
You’re late. I was worried sick.

00:25:44.857 --> 00:25:46.505
I’m fine. Don’t worry.

00:25:46.775 --> 00:25:48.500
How was the new school?

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:51.403
It…

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.455
It was fun.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:56.940
Fun?

00:26:00.241 --> 00:26:01.901
I’ll go take a shower.

00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:04.769
Hold on, dear.

00:26:05.008 --> 00:26:06.381
Did you have dinner?

00:26:06.964 --> 00:26:07.964
I got it.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.316
There’s no place for you here.

00:27:20.412 --> 00:27:21.412
Atom, you jerk!

00:27:22.801 --> 00:27:23.881
Why did you do this to him!

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:25.003
What did you do that for?

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:26.803
- Call a teacher!
- He’s bleeding!

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.949
You’re a jerk!

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.675
Isn’t he your friend?

00:27:29.692 --> 00:27:31.705
This is exactly why no one wants
to be your friend!

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.300
Samut.

00:27:58.277 --> 00:27:59.277
Hey, Samut.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.355
It’s all thanks to you.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.302
Thank you, Samut.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.101
Look.
STUDENT WHO BASHES FRIEND MOVES SCHOOL

00:28:54.101 --> 00:28:54.327
STUDENT WHO BASHES FRIEND MOVES SCHOOL

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.504
Someone at our school posted
this video of Samut.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.161
So he really is smart,
but he also really attacked a student.

00:29:02.581 --> 00:29:04.703
So what if he’s smart
if he’s a bad person?

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.020
Don’t you think so?

00:29:08.087 --> 00:29:12.505
Maybe he’s not as bad as
everyone thinks he is.

00:29:14.078 --> 00:29:15.558
You still say that after seeing this?

00:29:34.858 --> 00:29:36.500
You’d better stay away from him.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.800
When Don got out of the game,

00:29:51.196 --> 00:29:52.507
he got this medal.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.355
You watch movies too much, Benz.

00:29:56.496 --> 00:29:57.631
That’s just impossible.

00:29:57.793 --> 00:29:58.901
A dice game?

00:29:59.479 --> 00:30:00.479
Right?

00:30:00.887 --> 00:30:03.326
Bet I can buy a medal like this anywhere.

00:30:03.341 --> 00:30:04.941
Just give that back to me, you jerkface.

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:06.107
I’m not fibbing!

00:30:06.993 --> 00:30:07.993
He’s right.

00:30:08.042 --> 00:30:09.904
But you wouldn’t believe us anyway.

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.140
You gotta prove it for yourselves.

00:30:25.138 --> 00:30:26.138
Samut, hey.

00:30:28.783 --> 00:30:29.783
Why don’t you sit here?

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.327
I’ll find another...

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.340
It’s alright.

00:30:42.316 --> 00:30:43.316
You can sit here.

00:30:53.524 --> 00:30:54.524
Thanks.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.898
It’s me who has to thank you.

00:30:58.938 --> 00:31:00.404
You helped us win that game.

00:31:01.574 --> 00:31:02.574
Thanks.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.250
You came up with the elimination plan
in the first place.

00:31:08.273 --> 00:31:10.300
You helped us win it, too.

00:31:15.734 --> 00:31:16.734
Oh, hey.

00:31:17.145 --> 00:31:19.904
You’re looking to join
an academic club, right?

00:31:22.027 --> 00:31:23.027
Yeah.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.060
The Headmaster told me I need to.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.260
What’s up?

00:31:28.765 --> 00:31:31.381
Will you come with me after lunch?

00:31:31.903 --> 00:31:33.063
I want to show you something.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.800
You won a state competition, didn’t you?

00:31:47.619 --> 00:31:48.320
You’re good.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.580
I’m showing it at an expo in Korea soon.
The beginning of next month, actually.

00:31:52.075 --> 00:31:53.901
I have a lot of expectations
for this project.

00:31:54.858 --> 00:31:58.904
The innovation expo I’m going to
is a big annual event.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.058
To be invited as a participant

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.203
will be really good for my portfolio
when I apply for college.

00:32:06.922 --> 00:32:07.922
Samut.

00:32:09.304 --> 00:32:11.103
Do you want to help me with this project?

00:32:14.712 --> 00:32:17.100
How do you know I can do this?

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:19.710
Mamay told me.

00:32:22.073 --> 00:32:23.073
Mamay?

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:27.790
Well?

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.840
Are you interested?

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.180
Of course.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.700
Thanks for asking.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.500
Oh.

00:32:39.209 --> 00:32:40.609
I have something I want to ask you.

00:32:45.735 --> 00:32:46.735
The dice?

00:32:47.572 --> 00:32:48.807
Why do you have it?

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:51.575
I found it after the game.

00:32:53.613 --> 00:32:55.603
Do you know anything about this?

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:56.890
I do.

00:33:03.251 --> 00:33:05.501
That dice fell out of the box
of the Board Game Club.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.400
Board Game Club?

00:33:08.081 --> 00:33:09.721
Our school doesn’t have a club like that.

00:33:10.163 --> 00:33:12.706
Well then, we’ll set one up
right here and now.

00:33:12.883 --> 00:33:13.883
Give it to me.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:18.750
There you go, bud.

00:33:19.672 --> 00:33:20.703
What are you going to do?

00:33:21.613 --> 00:33:22.613
Play the game.

00:33:25.251 --> 00:33:26.251
You ready?

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:50.980
Oh?

00:33:51.556 --> 00:33:52.556
Why isn’t it working?

00:33:53.071 --> 00:33:54.071
Let me try.

00:34:04.043 --> 00:34:05.100
I told you guys.

00:34:05.815 --> 00:34:06.815
They’re freaking liars.

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:09.056
Let’s just go.

00:34:09.456 --> 00:34:10.456
What the hell?

00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:12.806
- I swear it worked before.
- What a waste of time.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.200
Why isn’t it working?

00:34:15.901 --> 00:34:17.581
You idiots did something to it,
didn’t you?

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.980
No, we didn’t.

00:34:20.353 --> 00:34:21.707
How come it’s not working, then?

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.383
Maybe… the condition isn’t right.

00:34:29.071 --> 00:34:31.498
When–When you play board games,

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:36.501
you need a certain condition or situation
in order to roll the dice.

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:41.779
Maybe the condition now isn’t
the same as last time.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.340
Then I just have to create this certain
condition you’re talking about.

00:35:12.374 --> 00:35:13.580
Samut, hold on.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:18.610
What’s the matter?

00:35:19.698 --> 00:35:20.700
I…

00:35:21.645 --> 00:35:23.008
I want to thank you

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:26.102
for winning the game.

00:35:27.287 --> 00:35:28.701
I got out because of you.

00:35:29.266 --> 00:35:32.603
Otherwise, I don’t know how long
I’d be stuck there.

00:35:35.701 --> 00:35:36.701
It’s alright.

00:35:37.138 --> 00:35:38.138
Was that all?

00:35:42.427 --> 00:35:43.427
Goodbye.

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:44.841
Wait!

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.600
Well…

00:35:50.712 --> 00:35:52.627
I also want to apologize

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:56.202
for judging you.

00:35:57.153 --> 00:36:00.401
I know now that you’re not
that kind of person.

00:36:00.929 --> 00:36:05.701
And… I want everyone to see
that good side of you that I see, too.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.852
I didn’t win that game all by myself.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:15.140
It was because of everyone’s effort.

00:36:16.683 --> 00:36:21.300
You, Kaen, Mark, Don, and Aom.

00:36:23.704 --> 00:36:24.704
Aom…

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:28.485
What’s wrong?

00:36:30.886 --> 00:36:34.007
I’ve been a student here for a long time,

00:36:34.141 --> 00:36:35.901
but I’ve never seen Aom before.

00:36:44.783 --> 00:36:45.859
I have to go.

00:36:46.338 --> 00:36:47.402
Something came up.

00:37:37.147 --> 00:37:38.147
What are you doing?

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.577
What else would I be doing in a library
but looking for books?

00:37:45.601 --> 00:37:46.761
What a weird question to ask.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.566
This library is for students only.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:56.054
What are you saying?

00:37:57.248 --> 00:37:59.903
I’m saying you may not even
be a student here.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.755
Mamay said she’d never seen you before.

00:38:05.201 --> 00:38:08.401
Are you accusing me just because
someone’s never seen me before?

00:38:11.947 --> 00:38:13.101
What is that student’s name?

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:16.398
I just moved to this school.

00:38:17.501 --> 00:38:18.774
I don’t really know anyone.

00:38:18.892 --> 00:38:20.199
So you understand now.

00:38:20.626 --> 00:38:22.205
Just because you go to the same school,

00:38:22.371 --> 00:38:23.903
it doesn’t mean you know everybody.

00:38:25.444 --> 00:38:26.501
Now leave me alone.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.040
Aom.

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:32.490
Aom.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.020
Do you know anything about
the Board Game Club?

00:38:41.157 --> 00:38:42.508
It seems you do.

00:38:46.466 --> 00:38:47.577
I don’t know anything.

00:38:53.479 --> 00:38:54.479
Hello, Kaen?

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.600
Samut?

00:38:55.778 --> 00:38:57.002
I’m with Kaen.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:59.701
Come to the gym right now.
We’re playing this game.

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:01.170
What?

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:02.872
You’re playing the game again?

00:39:03.423 --> 00:39:03.950
Hello?

00:39:04.316 --> 00:39:05.334
Game?

00:39:05.672 --> 00:39:07.107
Do you still have that dice?

00:39:10.561 --> 00:39:11.561
Don has it.

00:39:13.216 --> 00:39:14.700
He wants to play the game again.

00:39:15.756 --> 00:39:17.106
Where is the dice right now?

00:39:20.498 --> 00:39:21.708
It’s at the gym.

00:39:30.762 --> 00:39:31.762
Aom?

00:39:36.386 --> 00:39:37.386
Mamay?

00:39:37.667 --> 00:39:38.667
Kaen?

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.507
Oh, they show up in pairs, huh?

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.101
But that means we have
all eight people here.

00:39:44.519 --> 00:39:45.759
What do you think you’re doing?

00:39:46.147 --> 00:39:47.947
Setting the right condition
to start the game.

00:39:49.529 --> 00:39:52.798
Kaen said the dice will only work
under certain circumstances.

00:39:53.086 --> 00:39:54.600
So I’m tracing our footsteps.

00:39:54.849 --> 00:39:56.600
Stop it! Do not roll that dice!

00:39:59.228 --> 00:40:00.499
How would we play otherwise?

00:40:01.064 --> 00:40:03.575
Do you think the rest of us
want to play with you?

00:40:07.923 --> 00:40:08.923
I want to.

00:40:10.576 --> 00:40:11.903
It’s just a game, isn’t it?

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:13.810
Why are you so serious?

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.500
Go on, then.

00:40:24.396 --> 00:40:25.396
Roll the dice.

00:40:26.451 --> 00:40:27.900
It’s just a game anyway, isn’t it?

00:40:44.378 --> 00:40:45.779
Why aren’t we in the game?

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.208
Maybe the game only works once?

00:40:50.783 --> 00:40:51.900
Are you happy now?

00:41:04.523 --> 00:41:06.600
You know how to activate
the game, don’t you?

00:41:11.049 --> 00:41:12.049
I don’t.

00:41:12.813 --> 00:41:14.000
Now hand me the dice.

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:17.450
If you don’t know anything about it,
why do you want the dice so badly?

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.630
So the condition has nothing to do
with the number of players.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.603
The place isn’t, either.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.200
I assume it also doesn’t have anything
to do with the person who rolls the dice.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:48.570
Time, isn’t it?

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:10.404
It’s all thanks to you.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.506
Thank you, Samut.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.560
I’m sorry,

00:42:21.521 --> 00:42:23.094
but I also want to play.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.200
Stop!

00:42:51.562 --> 00:42:55.701
Are we… back in the game, Kaen?

00:42:56.187 --> 00:42:57.501
Why did you roll the dice?

00:42:57.624 --> 00:43:00.502
You said it yourself
that it’s all just a game.

00:43:01.575 --> 00:43:02.815
Unless there is something more.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.998
Battle of the Skyscrapers.

00:43:08.963 --> 00:43:10.443
Do we have to auction for the pieces?

00:43:12.483 --> 00:43:14.104
Help me complete three columns.

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:15.609
I must come out on top.

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:17.070
If you refuse,

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.603
I will tell everyone what you did.
