00:01:15.713 --> 00:01:16.914
Nanta

00:01:16.957 --> 00:01:19.620
is a country that is filled with forests
and abundant natural resources.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.780
It was once being prosperous from trading

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:24.020
and it was targeted by France.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.340
When conflict of interest led to a war,

00:01:27.777 --> 00:01:30.460
Nanta couldn't do anything but lost its major city

00:01:30.603 --> 00:01:33.140
called Chansaeng to France.

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:36.460
France had ruled the city for 50 years
in exchange for Nanta's peace.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.580
As Nanta started to become a republic and

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:42.140
ended its old monarchy system,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.260
Chansaeng, a city being colonized by France,

00:01:46.563 --> 00:01:49.420
surprisingly maintained its own roots and traditions.

00:01:50.057 --> 00:01:52.860
The agreement will end soon.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.140
And Chansaeng

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.500
will return to Republic of Nanta.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.620
1963 ( 2506 BE )

00:02:02.543 --> 00:02:03.740
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

00:02:04.637 --> 00:02:06.300
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

00:02:06.757 --> 00:02:08.020
WE NEED FREEDOM!

00:02:08.177 --> 00:02:10.820
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:15.100
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.140
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:22.140
Chansaeng City was colonized by a foreigner for 50 years.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.060
We will gain freedom in six months.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.380
- We want to be ruled independently, don't we?
- That's right!

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.420
- We don't want to be a part of Nanta anymore, do we?
- That's right!

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.781
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:37.660
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:55.223
Today, we're holding an offering ceremony

00:02:56.637 --> 00:02:58.543
to our ancestors and holy ghosts.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.100
Please take care of our family, our house,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.140
and people of Chansaeng.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.100
May peace be with the city.

00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:45.460
Princess Sridara.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.940
Prince Kamfah and his son are here.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.021
Kamfah?

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.750
How was your discussion with Nanta going?

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.900
We will be combined with Nanta in the next six months.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.900
I'm so worried about this.

00:04:05.223 --> 00:04:06.224
Grandma,

00:04:07.224 --> 00:04:08.660
don't worry about it.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.340
Our agreements remain the same.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.260
Nanta understands us so well.

00:04:14.163 --> 00:04:16.700
Even though there's no more monarchy system in Nanta,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.420
we're still safe.

00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:23.060
I also visited Uncle Lafah and he's doing well.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.380
All royal family members in Nanta

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.820
can live their lives normally, like one of their citizens.

00:04:30.017 --> 00:04:31.820
They no longer have their titles,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.820
but the government still respects them.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.540
As long as Mr.Santi,
the prime minister of Nanta, is ruling the nation,

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.343
after the handover,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.060
it will be nothing change with our family.

00:04:49.177 --> 00:04:51.380
Everyone needs to stay calm.

00:04:51.777 --> 00:04:53.420
I, Gen. Kalong,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.750
am ready and happy to serve people of Nanta.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.100
From now on, people of Nanta will gain prosperity equally.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.180
There will be no more elite class or capitalists

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.700
who took advantage of the nation like before.

00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:15.820
I will steer the nation to the new era.

00:05:16.797 --> 00:05:18.100
- You can't take that!
- Stop!

00:05:18.357 --> 00:05:20.500
Stop! You need to stop now!

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.900
This is my order! Stop it!

00:05:23.137 --> 00:05:24.138
Mr.Lafah!

00:05:25.717 --> 00:05:29.220
These items belong to my ancestors.

00:05:29.657 --> 00:05:32.940
Your ancestors who became wealthy from oppressing people?

00:05:33.263 --> 00:05:35.780
I guess the former leaders must be too kind.

00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:37.900
That's why royal family members and capitalists

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.100
own so many national properties like these.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.500
I will bring Nanta to the new era.

00:05:44.181 --> 00:05:48.780
All items that you used to own will return back to the nation.

00:05:49.677 --> 00:05:52.460
- Sir? The cinerary urn!
- Stop that!

00:05:52.733 --> 00:05:53.740
You need to stop right now.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.300
You can't take my grandfather's cinerary urn!

00:05:56.363 --> 00:05:57.220
Give it back to me!

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.340
I told you to give it back to me! Let it go!

00:06:00.457 --> 00:06:03.660
- I told you to let it go!
- Honey!

00:06:11.043 --> 00:06:12.860
There is no royal family's property.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.000
There is only national property.

00:06:24.137 --> 00:06:25.900
There is a new Nanta's leader.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.060
Will it affect our city?

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.380
This Kalong guy is a headstrong leader.

00:06:34.077 --> 00:06:36.200
- I'm afraid that the agreement…
- Prince Kamfah.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.900
Prince Inthorn is here to see you.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.821
Hi, brother.

00:06:53.303 --> 00:06:54.680
How're you my beloved nephew?

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.660
Long time no see.

00:06:56.821 --> 00:06:58.580
Come on, give me a hug. I missed you.

00:06:59.957 --> 00:07:00.958
What do you want?

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.420
You know that I won't give you any money for gambling.

00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:05.820
Come on.

00:07:06.337 --> 00:07:08.460
Why're you seeing me in a negative way?

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.260
I'm here because I'm worried about you.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.517
(Prince Lafah passed away.
Gen. Kalong shot the whole family.)

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.060
Lafah?

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.980
Kalong shot all of them in their house.

00:07:35.837 --> 00:07:39.780
I heard that he would seize all properties from

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.620
royal family members in Nanta.

00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:47.460
Dad? When Chansaeng is free from France

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.540
and handed over to Nanta,

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:51.811
then we will…

00:07:52.723 --> 00:07:54.860
You will face the same situation
as Prince Lafah for sure, my dear.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.800
Don't you worry, I always find solutions for you.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.150
This is Duangkamol, she's my Thai wife.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.300
Why don't you say hi to them?

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.000
Hello, sir.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.770
Your Dad can transfer all of his assets

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.420
to Duangkamol, my wife.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.181
And you can move to Thailand
before Chansaeng returning to Nanta.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.100
Then Kalong can't do anything to us.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.340
You think I'm stupid enough
to transfer my assets to your wife?

00:08:25.517 --> 00:08:27.300
You will spend them all in casinos.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.860
It's better to share some with me

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.220
than have Kalong seize all of your assets.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.700
Let me go!

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.940
I'm one of your bosses.

00:08:42.037 --> 00:08:44.780
Get them out of here! Don't let them in anymore!

00:08:45.697 --> 00:08:47.340
- Brother!
- Go!

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.270
You will be sorry for treating me this way.

00:08:49.317 --> 00:08:50.900
Duangkamol! Hurry up and follow me!

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.931
Let me go!

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.620
- Let me go!
- Dad?

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.340
What should we do next?

00:09:10.437 --> 00:09:12.300
My Little Prince,

00:09:12.703 --> 00:09:15.780
your Dad went to see consul of France.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.340
I'm sure they can find solutions for us.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.340
Please come here and have a sip of tea to calm down.

00:09:29.617 --> 00:09:30.618
Thank you.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.701
Dad?

00:09:40.237 --> 00:09:42.500
Homthip? Can you give us a minute?

00:09:42.797 --> 00:09:43.798
Sure, sir.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.140
Mr.Consul said that right now

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.300
France can help taking care of us.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.860
Kalong can't do anything to us at the moment.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.781
But…

00:10:03.517 --> 00:10:06.780
After Chansaeng is handed over to Nanta,

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.600
France has no power

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.200
and can't interfere with internal affairs.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.200
You meant that

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.220
in the next six months

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.600
our assets will be seized

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.020
and got shot just like they did to Uncle Lafah?

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.580
We still have time.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.820
I already found a way out.

00:10:37.757 --> 00:10:40.100
You need to get married with a Thai woman.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.700
We can transfer assets to your wife

00:10:45.963 --> 00:10:48.200
and relocate everyone to Thailand.

00:10:48.557 --> 00:10:50.400
- Dad?
- Don't worry.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.820
I already found you a wife.

00:10:55.143 --> 00:10:58.500
Her name is Pin-anong.
She's Prince Bodin's daughter.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.260
You knew her well.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.460
They're close to us, they won't betray us.

00:11:07.023 --> 00:11:07.740
I'm not getting married.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.380
This is about my entire life's happiness.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.300
Why're you forcing me? You're so selfish.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.700
Did you forget about riots around the city?

00:11:20.677 --> 00:11:23.500
When Kalong ruled over Chansaeng,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.180
things would get messier than this,
much more than this.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.700
There will be nothing left in our family.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.300
How dare you talk about your own happiness!

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.860
Who is the selfish one now?

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.500
Kamfah? Sankaew?

00:11:48.577 --> 00:11:50.200
What's going on?

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.750
Can't you just talk it out in civil way?

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.100
If you don't want to do this for me,

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.860
at least you should do this for your grandmother.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.460
She's getting older.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.020
She shouldn't struggle in the last stage of her life.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.140
(Sirichalalai Palace, Bangkok, Thailand)

00:12:28.777 --> 00:12:31.380
What? You wanted me to get married?

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.200
I think it's about time.

00:12:35.277 --> 00:12:36.600
I need to be honest with you.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.800
You know it well that we're having a hard time right now.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.171
We don't know when

00:12:42.683 --> 00:12:44.550
the creditors would come here to seize this palace.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.500
If you get married,

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.420
we'll earn dowry to save the palace.

00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:53.780
- But I…
- Why're you so picky about this?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.420
Your Dad and I took the best care of you

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.060
despite the fact that your mom was just a servant.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.141
You had no intentions of giving back to us at all?

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.141
Pin.

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:12.780
Do you remember Prince Sankaew?

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.300
Prince Sankaew took care of you
when you went to study in Penang.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.820
I already talked to Prince Kamfah

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.301
that you two should get married.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.700
A daughter of a mistress

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.200
gets married to a homeless prince,

00:13:30.077 --> 00:13:32.000
it seems like a perfect match.

00:13:45.397 --> 00:13:47.020
Get married with Sankaew?

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.900
Get married with a man I have a crush on.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.420
Sasin is so cool.

00:15:08.477 --> 00:15:09.340
Of course, he is.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.420
He's the best violinist of Rachawadee Club.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.220
- Sasin, hi!
- Hi, Waewwan.

00:15:47.057 --> 00:15:49.420
My birthday is next month.

00:15:50.097 --> 00:15:52.300
I'd like you to…

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.660
play violin at my birthday party, can you?

00:15:55.757 --> 00:15:58.340
I'd love to play at your birthday party,

00:15:58.623 --> 00:16:00.420
but I'm not sure if I'm free.

00:16:00.943 --> 00:16:04.980
If I accepted an offer from a pretty lady
and I turned you down later,

00:16:05.337 --> 00:16:06.900
I'd feel guilty for the rest of my life.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.380
What about this?

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.980
I can have Mingmitr, a golden voice singer,

00:16:13.377 --> 00:16:16.620
and Sanya, a good-looking guitarist,

00:16:16.777 --> 00:16:18.200
to take care of you instead.

00:16:18.837 --> 00:16:20.140
Happy birthday to you in advance.

00:16:21.157 --> 00:16:22.158
See you later.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.311
Where're you going?

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.741
What the heck?

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:25.940
Same as usual.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.900
You have good talking skill
but you've never dated anyone.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.660
I really want to know

00:16:31.003 --> 00:16:34.380
who would pin someone flirty like you down.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.340
If that person is not as pretty as my Rachawadee,

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:38.750
then I'm not interested.

00:16:39.403 --> 00:16:42.000
Enough with your sweet talk.
I'm not falling for you.

00:16:43.237 --> 00:16:44.340
Sasin.

00:16:45.023 --> 00:16:46.460
Pin?

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.800
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.621
How are you?

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.571
Your drinks.

00:17:09.997 --> 00:17:11.460
Thank you, Ms.Rachawadee.

00:17:13.297 --> 00:17:15.340
Pin! Stop!

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.211
This one is mine.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.021
Make yourself at home.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.580
What's going on about your marriage?

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.421
There's nothing more to update.
I told you all about it.

00:17:31.077 --> 00:17:32.860
You know that our palace is in a tough place.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.820
Dad sold parts of our lands
and we barely have anything left.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.800
The creditors want their money back.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.000
They wanted me to get married,
earn dowry to save the palace.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.220
But marriage without love won't last.

00:17:47.057 --> 00:17:50.460
Who told you that it wasn't out of love?

00:17:51.143 --> 00:17:52.200
Come on.

00:17:52.537 --> 00:17:55.800
Even if you get married to Prince Sankaew
that you kept telling me about,

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.037
we still can't trust him.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.500
I need to get married regardless.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.860
You know that I can't disagree
with my dad and Khunying Wad.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:09.820
It's a good thing that I get to marry Sankaew.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.420
He's not a stranger to me.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.960
If he loves you like you love him,

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.860
then I'm happy about this marriage.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.980
As your brother, I still need to see

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.540
if he can pass my criteria.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.940
And be the right man for you.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.371
Grandma.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.600
You're still up?

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.820
I can't sleep.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.820
I'm worried about our house and city.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.901
Chansaeng used to live peacefully.

00:19:42.101 --> 00:19:45.900
I don't know what's going to happen in the next six months.

00:19:49.323 --> 00:19:51.020
I heard that

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:56.061
old royal family members in Nanta were arrested

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.901
and killed, all of them.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.260
They're our relatives.

00:20:03.897 --> 00:20:06.300
It shouldn't have happened.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.700
I worry that soon

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.540
all of us will be…

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.021
Grandma.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.180
You don't need to worry about it.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.700
As your grandson,

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.020
and an heir of Chansaeng family.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.380
I will do anything to protect you.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.820
Our family will be safe.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.700
You have to believe me.

00:20:48.743 --> 00:20:50.300
It's gonna be alright.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.540
Did you pack up everything?

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.100
Yes, sir.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.020
But I worry about Princess Sridara.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.661
She has never left Chansaeng.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.300
She has never been far from here.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.800
Typical old lady.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.460
She doesn't want to live anywhere else.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.551
But it's better for her to leave.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.181
If there's any riot in Chansaeng,

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:35.951
it'll be hard for her.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:37.780
When you stay in Thailand,

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.860
you need to take care of everyone.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.700
When I'm done with handling our assets,

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.740
I'll rush to Thailand to talk about marriage.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.100
Prince Kamfah?

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.780
Can I say something to you?

00:21:58.837 --> 00:22:00.420
I know

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.260
that you love Prince Sankaew so much.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.820
About the marriage,

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.820
can you reconsider it?

00:22:13.297 --> 00:22:15.000
I feel bad for him.

00:22:17.463 --> 00:22:18.820
Sankaew told me

00:22:20.083 --> 00:22:22.200
that he wants to marry Pin-anong.

00:22:22.637 --> 00:22:23.700
He said that?

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.661
You think that someone like me would lie?

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.300
Of course not.

00:22:31.357 --> 00:22:32.980
I just think that…

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.060
you already lost Princess Dueanpradap.

00:22:41.183 --> 00:22:45.980
I'm worried that you could lose your son too.

00:22:56.817 --> 00:22:57.860
You know it well

00:23:00.903 --> 00:23:03.660
that I've already lost my one and only son.

00:23:11.737 --> 00:23:14.060
What would others say about us

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.380
if this scandal leaked out?

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.060
You are going to taint our reputation

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.000
and ruin our family, you ungrateful son!

00:23:25.261 --> 00:23:26.262
My Little Prince!

00:23:26.397 --> 00:23:28.260
Please stop!

00:23:29.563 --> 00:23:32.780
- Honey, please. I beg you.
- Don't stop me!

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.101
Dueanpradap?

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:39.901
Dueanpradap?

00:23:41.057 --> 00:23:42.058
Dueanpradap?

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.700
It's better for him to get married.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.340
Perhaps things will get better.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.341
(Bangkok, Thailand)

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.900
Where are Prince Bodin's people?

00:24:27.463 --> 00:24:30.380
I thought someone'd be here to pick us up.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.980
Why don't you have a seat and rest here?

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.900
I'll look around for Pin.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.800
- Please take care of her.
- Yes, sir.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.511
Easy there.

00:25:01.663 --> 00:25:03.220
Excuse me!

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:04.700
Out of the way!

00:25:15.483 --> 00:25:16.380
I'm sorry.

00:25:45.597 --> 00:25:46.900
Thank you for helping me.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.200
"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 1)

00:26:18.863 --> 00:26:19.864
Wait.

00:26:24.263 --> 00:26:25.780
Are you Prince Sankaew?

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.700
Your Grandma is with Prince Bodin's people now.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.500
But we couldn't find you

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.800
so I walked around and looked for you.

00:26:41.177 --> 00:26:43.460
How'd you know who I am?

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.500
I gave all credits to your Grandma.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.500
She explained how you look so vividly.

00:26:52.243 --> 00:26:53.244
How?

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.340
She said you wear all white, from head to toe.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.800
And she said that you looked like…

00:27:03.477 --> 00:27:04.478
Well, you really look like one.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.421
Look like what?

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:11.980
A rabbit.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:14.611
Hey!

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.980
Sankaew! This way.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.860
Can you behave for once?

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.301
Hello, Uncle.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.351
Hello, Khunying Wad.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.660
I'm glad that Sasin found you.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.141
I didn't know that you have an older brother.

00:27:37.317 --> 00:27:38.340
He isn't her brother.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.780
Sasin is Pin's cousin.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.200
Her mom's relatives brought him along from Ayutthaya.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.940
Prince Bodin was kind enough to raise him.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.740
I just live there, in the palace,

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.220
my role is a little bit better than a servant.

00:27:57.743 --> 00:27:59.300
Should we get going?

00:27:59.857 --> 00:28:03.100
- Grandma must be tired, this way please.
- Please follow me.

00:28:35.123 --> 00:28:37.100
You need to carry all of these to Thailand with you.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.700
Hide them well, don't let anyone see them.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:43.500
I will take care of selling our lands

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.900
and transfer assets in banks to Thailand.

00:28:48.141 --> 00:28:49.700
- I will follow you as soon as I'm done.
- Got it.

00:28:55.323 --> 00:28:57.200
Kalong has eyes and ears everywhere.

00:28:58.703 --> 00:28:59.904
When you're in Thailand,

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.300
you need to be cautious.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.100
You can't trust anyone.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.331
Ouch!

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.101
Are you okay?

00:30:54.183 --> 00:30:55.184
Excuse me!

00:31:00.803 --> 00:31:02.260
Is everything all right?

00:31:11.477 --> 00:31:12.478
Hey!

00:31:31.783 --> 00:31:32.784
What're you trying to do?

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:36.020
I asked what're you trying to do?

00:31:46.303 --> 00:31:47.304
Let me go!

00:31:47.603 --> 00:31:48.604
Let me go!

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.020
Let me go! Now!

00:31:52.963 --> 00:31:54.200
- Who're you?
- Let me go!

00:31:55.957 --> 00:31:56.958
Are you a thief?

00:32:00.763 --> 00:32:02.340
Don't try to run! Thief!

00:32:43.357 --> 00:32:44.358
Prince Sankaew?

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.020
What're you doing in my place?

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.061
Let me go first.

00:33:09.683 --> 00:33:10.684
I'm sorry.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.060
How did you get here?

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.701
I heard loud noise and someone yelled.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.100
I thought that someone got hurt.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.300
Right. It's my voice.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.681
I went to a bathroom and I slipped.

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.340
I was drunk.

00:33:41.163 --> 00:33:43.780
Since you're already here,

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.621
you wanna stay for a drink?

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.460
I have a lot to ask you.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.901
But you're just sobering up.

00:33:52.463 --> 00:33:53.500
You wanna continue drinking?

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.900
Who said I couldn't do it?

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.660
Well, normal people won't do something like this.

00:34:03.683 --> 00:34:06.060
Come on, Mr.Sankaew.

00:34:07.123 --> 00:34:10.780
Normal people won't sneak into
someone else's house at night either.

00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:13.600
- Hey! I already told you that…
- Come on.

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:18.860
I was just kidding. You're too serious.

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:24.171
I'll pass.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.380
I have something to do early morning.

00:34:27.137 --> 00:34:28.420
I don't think I can stay for a drink.

00:34:30.057 --> 00:34:31.058
I gotta go.

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.345
I'm not walking you out.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:39.660
Something to do? Early morning?

00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:48.660
My dad wants to leave this area as a garden.

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.020
Because he really likes a place by the river.

00:34:54.223 --> 00:34:55.540
This is so nice and green.

00:35:00.263 --> 00:35:02.380
I'll need to buy some ingredients for Luk Chup,

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.020
your grandma asked me to teach her tomorrow.

00:35:06.963 --> 00:35:10.060
Thank you for taking care of her.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.820
Let's go to the other side.

00:35:24.057 --> 00:35:27.300
My mom and I used to live in a small house over there.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.020
Now my dad lets Sasin stay there.

00:35:30.537 --> 00:35:32.260
I'm not sure if he's up yet.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:35.900
I think we should go there and wake him up.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.572
Let him sleep in. We shouldn't bother him.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.100
I think he's gonna wake up in the afternoon.

00:35:50.703 --> 00:35:52.900
Oh! You're here!

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.940
Why did you think that I'd be such a lazy person

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.740
who would wake up in the afternoon?

00:36:01.781 --> 00:36:03.940
I assumed from what I saw last night.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.300
Last night?

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.551
Did you meet up with Sasin last night?

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.220
By coincidence.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.460
Well, I don't think so.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.140
- You intended to break into my house to see me.
- Huh?

00:36:18.583 --> 00:36:21.140
Hey! I told you that it was just a misunderstanding.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.900
Misunderstanding about what?

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.821
I'm so confused.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.380
A thief broke into my house last night.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:35.020
When I looked at him closely, it wasn't really a thief.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.991
But he was…

00:36:37.777 --> 00:36:38.778
A rabbit.

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:40.340
A rabbit?

00:36:41.963 --> 00:36:44.940
- What rabbit?
- Pin.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.697
If you want to hear a true version of this story,

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.580
this man had too many drinks, he was drunk

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.140
and he slipped to the floor so loud.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.340
I was so shocked so I went inside to check on him.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.580
That drunk guy blamed me for being a thief.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.661
Well, that drunk guy felt bad about it.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.860
He made it up by offering a drink.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:11.940
He didn't expect that the other guy
would be disgusted by a poor drunk man

00:37:12.383 --> 00:37:13.821
and turned down the offer.

00:37:13.897 --> 00:37:14.898
Hey!

00:37:15.223 --> 00:37:17.420
Looking down on people is not my trait.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.261
I think we should call it off.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.000
I'm still confused.

00:37:22.821 --> 00:37:27.140
But it looked like both of you got along really well.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.300
I'm glad to see both of you this way.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.420
Thank you for driving me around.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:22.540
Otherwise, Sankaew and I
wouldn't get a chance to visit temples.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:24.661
My pleasure.

00:38:25.283 --> 00:38:28.220
I'm happy to drive you around today, just name a place.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.600
I will take the best care of you

00:38:31.177 --> 00:38:32.778
and Mr.Sankaew.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.140
You should look ahead when you drive.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:53.820
Why did you keep looking at the rearview mirror?

00:38:55.883 --> 00:38:59.100
How did you know that I kept looking at the rearview mirror?

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.460
Whenever I looked into the mirror, I saw you staring at it.

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.820
Well, I'm driving, of course I need to
look at the rearview mirror all the time

00:39:06.943 --> 00:39:08.060
for safety.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.861
You're the one who keeps looking at me.

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:12.140
Hey! I didn't look at you.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:14.157
- You didn't? Why did you…
- Whoa!

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.580
You two hit it off so fast.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.700
You have no trouble with the conversation.

00:40:06.057 --> 00:40:07.900
I pray to the Buddha statue here.

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.603
I feel so helpless

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.380
with no place called home.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.861
I'd like to ask for your mercy.

00:40:20.061 --> 00:40:23.200
Please enlighten me to find a way to save my house

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.981
from Gen. Kalong's cruelty.

00:40:26.617 --> 00:40:29.500
I don't want Pin to be involved with this sadness and sorrow.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.820
I don't want to see anyone in pain.

00:40:33.877 --> 00:40:35.860
I don't want anyone to be distressed
because of me anymore.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:58.901
Where's Pin?

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.341
Shopping.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:03.340
For making dessert with your grandma.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.701
Do you love Pin?

00:41:12.317 --> 00:41:13.318
Why did you ask?

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.820
You're getting married to her, I need to know.

00:41:20.663 --> 00:41:21.940
Before her mom passed away,

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:23.901
she asked me to take care of her.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.102
I already know her feelings about this.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.260
And I want to know about your feeling,

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.020
to see if it's the same as Pin's.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:35.500
Pin is a good person.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.461
That's not my question.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.260
I only mean well to her.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:46.940
Still not my question.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:52.340
Just tell me if you love her or not.

00:41:52.783 --> 00:41:53.784
Not that hard.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.900
It's not that simple to

00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:01.800
explain people's feeling.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.460
It seems hard when someone like you make it hard.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:23.900
Love is simple.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.420
If the two of you have the same feeling,
that is what matters.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.980
But people tend to mix status, suitability,

00:42:32.741 --> 00:42:35.100
and money with love.

00:42:38.542 --> 00:42:41.340
For me, if I love someone,

00:42:43.143 --> 00:42:44.700
I'll tell them how I feel.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.060
If they love me back,

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.620
then they will be my happiness

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.540
and I will be theirs.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.220
I don't care about social status, suitability

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.701
or other's opinions.

00:43:02.301 --> 00:43:03.302
It's that simple.

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:10.700
If I can live my life as I please like you,

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:13.861
it'd be great.

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.750
Why's that? What's wrong with your life?

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.460
Wealthy people's lives or

00:43:28.903 --> 00:43:32.220
royal family members' lives are much
better than a low-income musician like me.

00:43:34.103 --> 00:43:35.104
What about my question?

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.020
How do you feel about Pin?

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.740
My feeling

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:46.140
is none of your business.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.021
It's in my heart.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.660
I don't need to share it with you.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.061
(National Bank of Chansaeng)

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:30.020
Please let your people in Thailand know that
they can open bank accounts.

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:34.220
I will take care of transferring money and all assets

00:44:34.563 --> 00:44:38.020
to your new bank accounts in Thailand as soon as possible.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:40.550
Thank you so much.

00:44:42.021 --> 00:44:44.300
- Please make it quick.
- Yes, sir.

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:47.611
Mr.Kamfah.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.500
I hope you don't mind that I called you a mister.

00:45:01.117 --> 00:45:04.220
There are no more royal titles back in Nanta
for quite a while now.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.541
I didn't expect to see you here.

00:45:08.603 --> 00:45:09.604
Why's that?

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.500
This bank is taken care by Chansaeng.

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.800
But in the next six months,
Chansaeng will be combined with Nanta.

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.100
I'm here to check on it.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.300
I hope you know that

00:45:28.341 --> 00:45:31.000
after Chansaeng going back to Nanta,

00:45:31.142 --> 00:45:34.060
it will be inspection of bank's transactions

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.900
to see if there's any abnormal asset transfers.

00:45:39.823 --> 00:45:40.824
Got it.

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:43.420
I hope you won't be involved with anything

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:44.780
that could lead to troubles in the future.

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.620
Got it, General.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.580
Wait a minute, Mr.Kamfah.

00:45:54.877 --> 00:45:56.700
Where is your son, Sankaew?

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.580
Why are you asking about him?

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.220
I was just being polite.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.021
Politeness

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:11.460
doesn't suit you well.

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.100
I'm a soldier.

00:46:14.637 --> 00:46:16.580
I'm familiar with rules and orders only.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:19.461
I'm not familiar with manners.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.820
It must be irritating to a royal family member like you.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.981
When Chansaeng is handed over to Nanta,

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:30.820
I'll teach you rules and orders like we do in military.

00:46:31.617 --> 00:46:32.618
Sounds good?

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:46.821
Sir?

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.150
I don't know how much he knows about our plan.

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.300
I'm so worried about my son.

00:48:05.137 --> 00:48:06.380
My feeling

00:48:08.403 --> 00:48:09.580
is none of your business.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.860
It's in my heart.

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.380
I don't need to share it with you.

00:48:29.183 --> 00:48:30.540
What do you feel inside?

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.820
Why're you playing such a sad song?
